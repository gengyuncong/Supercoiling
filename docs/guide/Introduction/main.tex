\chapter{Introduction}

This User's Guide contains instructions for using the Lattice Microbes software, as described in the following publications: \cite{Roberts2009lts},\cite{Roberts2011nci},\cite{Roberts2012slm}. This guide is very much a work in progress and will continue to be expanded. At present, it should contain enough information to get started using the Lattice Microbes software.
