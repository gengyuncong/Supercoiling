title = {Theory for the stability and regulation of epigenetic landscapes},
abstract = {Cells can often choose among several stably heritable phenotypes. Examples are the expressions of genes in eukaryotic cells where long chromosomal regions can adopt persistent and heritable silenced or active states that may be associated with positive feedback in dynamic modification of nucleosomes. We generalize this mechanism in terms of bistability associated with valleys in an epigenetic landscape. A transfer matrix method was used to rigorously follow the system through the disruptive process of cell division. This combined treatment of noisy dynamics both between and during cell division provides an efficient way to calculate the stability of alternative states in a broad range of epigenetic systems.},

title = {State-dependent biasing method for importance sampling in the weighted stochastic simulation algorithm},
abstract = {The weighted stochastic simulation algorithm (wSSA) was developed by Kuwahara and Mura [J. Chem. Phys. 129, 165101 (2008)] to efficiently estimate the probabilities of rare events in discrete stochastic systems. The wSSA uses importance sampling to enhance the statistical accuracy in the estimation of the probability of the rare event. The original algorithm biases the reaction selection step with a fixed importance sampling parameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel method where the biasing parameter is state-dependent. The new method features improved accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.},

title = {MAP kinase pathways in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae},
abstract = {A cascade of three protein kinases known as a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is commonly found as part of the signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells. Almost two decades of genetic and biochemical experimentation plus the recently completed DNA sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome have revealed just five functionally distinct MAPK cascades in this yeast. Sexual conjugation, cell growth, and adaptation to stress, for example, all require MAPK-mediated cellular responses. A primary function of these cascades appears to be the regulation of gene expression in response to extracellular signals or as part of specific developmental processes. In addition, the MAPK cascades often appear to regulate the cell cycle and vice versa. Despite the success of the gene hunter era in revealing these pathways, there are still many significant gaps in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms for activation of these cascades and how the cascades regulate cell function. For example, comparison of different yeast signaling pathways reveals a surprising variety of different types of upstream signaling proteins that function to activate a MAPK cascade, yet how the upstream proteins actually activate the cascade remains unclear. We also know that the yeast MAPK pathways regulate each other and interact with other signaling pathways to produce a coordinated pattern of gene expression, but the molecular mechanisms of this cross talk are poorly understood. This review is therefore an attempt to present the current knowledge of MAPK pathways in yeast and some directions for future research in this area.},

abstract = {The conserved protein-conducting channel, referred to as the Sec61 channel in eukaryotes or the SecY channel in eubacteria and archaea, translocates proteins across cellular membranes and integrates proteins containing hydrophobic transmembrane segments into lipid bilayers. Structural studies illustrate how the protein-conducting channel accomplishes these tasks. Three different mechanisms, each requiring a different set of channel binding partners, are employed to move polypeptide substrates: The ribosome feeds the polypeptide chain directly into the channel, a ratcheting mechanism is used by the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP, and a pushing mechanism is utilized by the bacterial ATPase SecA. We review these translocation mechanisms, relating biochemical and genetic observations to the structures of the protein-conducting channel and its binding partners.},

title = {A novel SET domain methyltransferase modifies ribosomal protein Rpl23ab in yeast},
abstract = {In vivo studies have shown that the ribosomal large subunit protein L23a (Rpl23ab) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is methylated at lysine residues. However, the gene encoding the methyltransferase responsible for the modification has not been identified. We show here that the yeast YPL208w gene product, a member of the SET domain family of methyltransferases, catalyzes the reaction, and we have now designated it Rkm1 (ribosomal lysine (K) methyltransferase 1). Yeast strains with deletion mutations in candidate SET domain-containing genes were in vivo labeled with S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-(3)H]methionine. [(3)H]Methyl radioactivity was determined after lysates were fractionated by SDS gel electrophoresis. When compared with the parent strain or other candidate deletion strains, a loss of a radiolabeled 15-kDa species was observed in the rkm1 (Deltaypl208w) knock-out strain. Treatment of wild-type cell extracts with RNase or proteinase K demonstrated that the methyl-accepting substrate is a protein. Cellular lysates from parent and knockout strains were fractionated using high salt sucrose gradients. Analysis of the gradient fractions by SDS gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the 15-kDa methyl-accepting substrate elutes with the large ribosomal subunit. In vitro methylation experiments using purified ribosomes confirmed that the methyl-accepting substrate is a ribosomal protein. Amino acid analysis of the in vivo labeled 15 kDa polypeptide showed that it contains epsilon-[(3)H]dimethyllysine residues. Mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides of the 15 kDa polypeptide identified it as Rpl23ab. Analysis of the intact masses of the large ribosomal subunit proteins by electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed that the substrate is Rpl23ab and that it is specifically dimethylated at two distinct sites by Rkm1. These results show that SET domain methyltransferases can be involved in translational roles as well as in the previously described transcriptional roles.},

title = {The nonequilibrium mechanism for ultrasensitivity in a biological switch: sensing by Maxwell's demons},
abstract = {The Escherichia coli flagellar motor senses the intracellular concentration of the response regulator CheY-P and responds by varying the bias between its counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) rotational states. The response is ultrasensitive with a large Hill coefficient (approximately 10). Recently, the detailed distribution functions of the CW and the CCW dwell times have been measured for different CW biases. Based on a general result on the properties of the dwell-time statistics for all equilibrium models, we show that the observed dwell-time statistics imply that the flagellar motor switch operates out of equilibrium, with energy dissipation. We propose a dissipative allosteric model that generates dwell-time statistics consistent with the experimental results. Our model reveals a general nonequilibrium mechanism for ultrasensitivity wherein the switch operates with a small energy expenditure to create high sensitivity. In contrast to the conventional equilibrium models, this mechanism does not require one to assume that CheY-P binds to the CCW and CW states with different affinities. The estimated energy consumption by the flagellar motor switch suggests that the transmembrane proton motive force, which drives the motor's rotation, may also power its switching. The existence of net transitional fluxes between microscopic states of the switch is predicted, measurement of these fluxes can test the nonequilibrium model directly. Both the results on the general properties of the dwell-time statistics and the mechanism for ultrasensitivity should be useful for understanding a diverse class of physical and biological systems.},

Surprisingly, pathways that transduce distinct signals can share protein components, yet avoid erroneous cross-talk. A highly tractable model system in which to study this paradox is the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which harbors three mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction cascades that share multiple signaling components. In this review we first describe potential mechanisms by which specificity could be achieved by signaling pathways that share components. Second, we summarize key features and components of the yeast MAPK pathways that control the mating pheromone response, filamentous growth, and the response to high osmolarity. Finally, we review biochemical analyses in yeast of mutations that cause cross-talk between these three MAPK pathways and their implications for the mechanistic bases for signaling specificity. Although much remains to be learned, current data indicate that scaffolding and cross pathway inhibition play key roles in the maintenance of fidelity.},

Multiple mechanisms ensure that rRNA synthesis rates are appropriate for the cell's particular growth condition. Recently, important advances have been made in our understanding of rRNA transcription initiation in Escherichia coli. These include (a) a model at the atomic level of the network of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions that recruit RNA polymerase to rRNA promoters, accounting for their extraordinary strength; (b) discovery of the nonredundant roles of two small molecule effectors, ppGpp and the initiating NTP, in regulation of rRNA transcription initiation; and (c) identification of a new component of the transcription machinery, DksA, that is absolutely required for regulation of rRNA promoter activity. Together, these advances provide clues important for our molecular understanding not only of rRNA transcription, but also of transcription in general.},

title = {Integrated analysis of metabolic phenotypes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important microorganism for both industrial processes and scientific research. Consequently, there have been extensive efforts to characterize its cellular processes. In order to fully understand the relationship between yeast's genome and its physiology, the stockpiles of diverse biological data sets that describe its cellular components and phenotypic behavior must be integrated at the genome-scale. Genome-scale metabolic networks have been reconstructed for several microorganisms, including S. cerevisiae, and the properties of these networks have been successfully analyzed using a variety of constraint-based methods. Phenotypic phase plane analysis is a constraint-based method which provides a global view of how optimal growth rates are affected by changes in two environmental variables such as a carbon and an oxygen uptake rate. Some applications of phenotypic phase plane analysis include the study of optimal growth rates and of network capacity and function.

RESULTS: In this study, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome-scale metabolic network was used to formulate a phenotypic phase plane that displays the maximum allowable growth rate and distinct patterns of metabolic pathway utilization for all combinations of glucose and oxygen uptake rates. In silico predictions of growth rate and secretion rates and in vivo data for three separate growth conditions (aerobic glucose-limited, oxidative-fermentative, and microaerobic) were concordant.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study examines the function and capacity of yeast's metabolic machinery and shows that the phenotypic phase plane can be used to accurately predict metabolic phenotypes and to interpret experimental data in the context of a genome-scale model.},

title = {Diffusion, crowding {\&} protein stability in a dynamic molecular model of the bacterial cytoplasm},
abstract = {A longstanding question in molecular biology is the extent to which the behavior of macromolecules observed in vitro accurately reflects their behavior in vivo. A number of sophisticated experimental techniques now allow the behavior of individual types of macromolecule to be studied directly in vivo; none, however, allow a wide range of molecule types to be observed simultaneously. In order to tackle this issue we have adopted a computational perspective, and, having selected the model prokaryote Escherichia coli as a test system, have assembled an atomically detailed model of its cytoplasmic environment that includes 50 of the most abundant types of macromolecules at experimentally measured concentrations. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the cytoplasm model have been calibrated to reproduce the translational diffusion coefficients of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) observed in vivo, and "snapshots" of the simulation trajectories have been used to compute the cytoplasm's effects on the thermodynamics of protein folding, association and aggregation events. The simulation model successfully describes the relative thermodynamic stabilities of proteins measured in E. coli, and shows that effects additional to the commonly cited "crowding" effect must be included in attempts to understand macromolecular behavior in vivo.},

The sheer size and intricacy of molecular networks of even the simplest organisms are obstacles toward understanding network functionality. This review discusses the achievements and promise of a bottom-up approach that uses well-characterized subnetworks as model systems for understanding larger networks. It highlights the interplay between the structure, logic, and function of various types of small regulatory circuits. The bottom-up approach advocates understanding regulatory networks as a collection of entangled motifs. We therefore emphasize the potential of negative and positive feedback, as well as their combinations, to generate robust homeostasis, epigenetics, and oscillations.},

title = {Effect of DNA looping on the induction kinetics of the lac operon},
abstract = {The induction of the lac operon follows cooperative kinetics. The first mechanistic model of these kinetics is the de facto standard in the modeling literature [Yagil, G., Yagil, E., 1971. On the relation between effector concentration and the rate of induced enzyme synthesis. Biophys. J. 11, 11-17]. Yet, subsequent studies have shown that the model is based on incorrect assumptions. Specifically, the repressor is a tetramer with four (not two) inducer-binding sites, and the operon contains two auxiliary operators (in addition to the main operator). Furthermore, these structural features are crucial for the formation of DNA loops, the key determinants of lac repression and induction. Indeed, the repression is determined almost entirely (>95%) by the looped complexes [Oehler, S., Eismann, E.R., Kr{\"a}mer, H., M{\"u}ller-Hill, B., 1990. The three operators of the lac operon cooperate in repression. EMBO J. 9(4), 973-979], and the pronounced cooperativity of the induction curve hinges upon the existence of the looped complexes [Oehler, S., Alberti, S., M{\"u}ller-Hill, B., 2006. Induction of the lac promoter in the absence of DNA loops and the stoichiometry of induction. Nucleic Acids Res. 34(2), 606-612]. Here, we formulate a model of lac induction taking due account of the tetrameric structure of the repressor and the existence of looped complexes. We show that: (1) The kinetics are significantly more cooperative than those predicted by the Yagil and Yagil model. The cooperativity is higher because the formation of looped complexes is easily abolished by repressor-inducer binding. (2) The model provides good fits to the repression data for cells containing wild-type tetrameric or mutant dimeric repressor, as well as the induction curves for 6 different strains of Escherichia coli. It also implies that the ratios of certain looped and non-looped complexes are independent of inducer and repressor levels, a conclusion that can be rigorously tested by gel electrophoresis. (3) Repressor overexpression dramatically increases the cooperativity of the induction curve. This suggests that repressor overexpression can induce bistability in systems, such as growth of E. coli on lactose, that are otherwise monostable.},

title = {Protein translocation across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane},
abstract = {About 25% to 30% of the bacterial proteins function in the cell envelope or outside of the cell. These proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, and the vast majority is recognized as a ribosome-bound nascent chain by the signal recognition particle (SRP) or by the secretion-dedicated chaperone SecB. Subsequently, they are targeted to the Sec translocase in the cytoplasmic membrane, a multimeric membrane protein complex composed of a highly conserved protein-conducting channel, SecYEG, and a peripherally bound ribosome or ATP-dependent motor protein SecA. The Sec translocase mediates the translocation of proteins across the membrane and the insertion of membrane proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane. Translocation requires the energy sources of ATP and the proton motive force (PMF) while the membrane protein insertion is coupled to polypeptide chain elongation at the ribosome. This review summarizes the present knowledge of the mechanism and structure of the Sec translocase, with a special emphasis on unresolved questions and topics of current research.},

title = {Transcriptional infidelity promotes heritable phenotypic change in a bistable gene network},
abstract = {Bistable epigenetic switches are fundamental for cell fate determination in unicellular and multicellular organisms. Regulatory proteins associated with bistable switches are often present in low numbers and subject to molecular noise. It is becoming clear that noise in gene expression can influence cell fate. Although the origins and consequences of noise have been studied, the stochastic and transient nature of RNA errors during transcription has not been considered in the origin or modeling of noise nor has the capacity for such transient errors in information transfer to generate heritable phenotypic change been discussed. We used a classic bistable memory module to monitor and capture transient RNA errors: the lac operon of Escherichia coli comprises an autocatalytic positive feedback loop producing a heritable all-or-none epigenetic switch that is sensitive to molecular noise. Using single-cell analysis, we show that the frequency of epigenetic switching from one expression state to the other is increased when the fidelity of RNA transcription is decreased due to error-prone RNA polymerases or to the absence of auxiliary RNA fidelity factors GreA and GreB (functional analogues of eukaryotic TFIIS). Therefore, transcription infidelity contributes to molecular noise and can effect heritable phenotypic change in genetically identical cells in the same environment. Whereas DNA errors allow genetic space to be explored, RNA errors may allow epigenetic or expression space to be sampled. Thus, RNA infidelity should also be considered in the heritable origin of altered or aberrant cell behaviour.},

title = {Interaction of effecting ligands with lac repressor and repressor-operator complex},
abstract = {The equilibrium association constants for the binding of a wide variety of effecting ligands of the lac repressor were measured by equilibrium dialysis. Also, detailed investigations of the apparent rate of dissociation of repressor-operator comples as a function of ligand concentration were carried out for several inducers and anti-inducers. The affinity of repressor-ligand comples for operator DNA was evaluated from the specific rate constants at saturating concentrations of effecting ligand. By fitting the experimental data depicting the functional dependence of the rate of dissociation upon ligand concentrations to calculated curves, assuming simple models of the induction mechanism, the equilibrium association constant for the binding of effecting ligand to repressor-operator comples was determined. Inducers reduce the affinity of lac repressor for operator DNA by a factor of approximately 1000 under standard conditions; the extent of destabilization depends on Mg2+ ion concentration. Anti-inducers increase the affinity of repressor for operator at most a factor of five. Only one neutral ligand, which binds to repressor without altering the stability of repressor-operator comples, was found. No homotropic or heterotropic interactions in the binding of effecting ligands either to repressor or to repressor-operator complex are evident.},

title = {Crowding effects on association reactions at membranes},
abstract = {The effect of macromolecular crowding on the binding of ligands to a receptor near membranes is studied using Brownian dynamics simulations. The receptor is modeled as a reactive patch on a hard surface and the ligands and crowding agents are modeled as spheres that interact via a steep repulsive interaction potential. When a ligand collides with the patch, it reacts with probability p(rxn). The association rate constant (k(infinity)) can be decomposed into contributions from diffusion-limited (k(D)) and reaction-limited (k(R)) rates, i.e., 1/k(infinity) = 1/k(D) + 1/k(R). The simulations show that k(D) is a nonmonotonic function of the volume fraction of crowding agents for receptors of small sizes. k(R) is always an increasing function of the volume fraction of crowding agents, and the association rate constant k(infinity) determined from both contributions has a qualitatively different dependence on the macromolecular crowding for high and low values of the reaction probability p(rxn). The simulation results are used to predict the velocity of the membrane protrusion driven by actin filament elongation. Based on the simple model where the protrusive force on the membrane is generated by the intercalation of actin monomers between the membrane and actin filament ends, we predict that crowding increases the local concentration of actin monomers near the filament ends and hence accelerates the membrane protrusion.},

title = {The diffusive influx and carrier efflux have a strong effect on the bistability of the lac operon in Escherichia coli},
abstract = {In the presence of gratuitous inducers, the lac operon of Escherichia coli exhibits bistability. Most models in the literature assume that the inducer enters the cell via the carrier (permease), and exits by a diffusion-like process. The diffusive influx and carrier efflux are neglected. However, analysis of the data shows that in non-induced cells, the diffusive influx is comparable to the carrier influx, and in induced cells, the carrier efflux is comparable to the diffusive efflux. Since bistability entails the coexistence of steady states corresponding to both non-induced and induced cells, neither one of these fluxes can be ignored. We present a model accounting for both fluxes, and show that: (1) The thresholds (i.e., the extracellular inducer levels at which transcription turns on or off) are profoundly affected by both fluxes. The diffusive influx reduces the on threshold, and eliminates irreversible bistability, a phenomenon that is inconsistent with data. The carrier efflux increases the off threshold, and abolishes bistability at large permease activities, a conclusion that can be tested experimentally. (2) The thresholds are well approximated by simple analytical expressions obtained by considering two limiting cases (no carrier efflux and no diffusive influx). (3) The simulations are in good agreement with the data for isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG), but somewhat discrepant with respect to the data for thiomethyl galactoside (TMG). We discuss the potential sources of the discrepancy.},

abstract = {In many stochastic simulations of biochemical reaction networks, it is desirable to "coarse grain" the reaction set, removing fast reactions while retaining the correct system dynamics. Various coarse-graining methods have been proposed, but it remains unclear which methods are reliable and which reactions can safely be eliminated. We address these issues for a model gene regulatory network that is particularly sensitive to dynamical fluctuations: a bistable genetic switch. We remove protein-DNA and/or protein-protein association-dissociation reactions from the reaction set using various coarse-graining strategies. We determine the effects on the steady-state probability distribution function and on the rate of fluctuation-driven switch flipping transitions. We find that protein-protein interactions may be safely eliminated from the reaction set, but protein-DNA interactions may not. We also find that it is important to use the chemical master equation rather than macroscopic rate equations to compute effective propensity functions for the coarse-grained reactions.},

title = {Ribosome biogenesis and the translation process in Escherichia coli},
abstract = {Translation, the decoding of mRNA into protein, is the third and final element of the central dogma. The ribosome, a nucleoprotein particle, is responsible and essential for this process. The bacterial ribosome consists of three rRNA molecules and approximately 55 proteins, components that are put together in an intricate and tightly regulated way. When finally matured, the quality of the particle, as well as the amount of active ribosomes, must be checked. The focus of this review is ribosome biogenesis in Escherichia coli and its cross-talk with the ongoing protein synthesis. We discuss how the ribosomal components are produced and how their synthesis is regulated according to growth rate and the nutritional contents of the medium. We also present the many accessory factors important for the correct assembly process, the list of which has grown substantially during the last few years, even though the precise mechanisms and roles of most of the proteins are not understood.},

title = {Tuning and controlling gene expression noise in synthetic gene networks},
abstract = {Synthetic gene networks can be used to control gene expression and cellular phenotypes in a variety of applications. In many instances, however, such networks can behave unreliably due to gene expression noise. Accordingly, there is a need to develop systematic means to tune gene expression noise, so that it can be suppressed in some cases and harnessed in others, e.g. in cellular differentiation to create population-wide heterogeneity. Here, we present a method for controlling noise in synthetic eukaryotic gene expression systems, utilizing reduction of noise levels by TATA box mutations and noise propagation in transcriptional cascades. Specifically, we introduce TATA box mutations into promoters driving TetR expression and show that these mutations can be used to effectively tune the noise of a target gene while decoupling it from the mean, with negligible effects on the dynamic range and basal expression. We apply mathematical and computational modeling to explain the experimentally observed effects of TATA box mutations. This work, which highlights some important aspects of noise propagation in gene regulatory cascades, has practical implications for implementing gene expression control in synthetic gene networks.},

title = {Bistable behavior in a model of the lac operon in Escherichia coli with variable growth rate},
abstract = {This work is a continuation from another study previously published in this journal. Both the former and the present works are dedicated to investigating the bistable behavior of the lac operon in Escherichia coli from a mathematical modeling point of view. In the previous article, we developed a detailed mathematical model that accounts for all of the known regulatory mechanisms in this system, and studied the effect of inducing the operon with lactose instead of an artificial inducer. In this article, the model is improved to account, in a more detailed way, for the interaction of the repressor molecules with the three lac operators. A recently discovered cooperative interaction between the CAP molecule (an activator of the lactose operon) and Operator 3 (which influences DNA folding) is also included in this new version of the model. The growth rate dependence on the rate of energy entering the bacteria (in the form of transported glucose molecules and of metabolized lactose molecules) is also considered. A large number of numerical experiments is carried out with this improved model. The results are discussed in regard to the bistable behavior of the lactose operon. Special attention is paid to the effect that a variable growth rate has on the system dynamics.},

title = {Reaction coordinates for the flipping of genetic switches},
abstract = {We present a detailed analysis, based on the forward flux sampling simulation method, of the switching dynamics and stability of two models of genetic toggle switches, consisting of two mutually repressing genes encoding transcription factors (TFs); in one model (the exclusive switch), the two transcription factors mutually exclude each other's binding, while in the other model (general switch), the two TFs can bind simultaneously to the shared operator region. We assess the role of two pairs of reactions that influence the stability of these switches: TF-TF homodimerization and TF-DNA association/dissociation. In both cases, the switch flipping rate increases with the rate of TF dimerization, while it decreases with the rate of TF-operator binding. We factorize the flipping rate k into the product of the probability rho(q*) of finding the system at the dividing surface (separatrix) between the two stable states, and a kinetic prefactor R. In the case of the exclusive switch, the rate of TF-operator binding affects both rho(q*) and R, while the rate of TF dimerization affects only R. The general switch displays a higher flipping rate than the exclusive switch, and both TF-operator binding and TF dimerization affect k, R, and rho(q*). To elucidate this, we analyze the transition state ensemble. For the exclusive switch, the transition state ensemble is strongly affected by the rate of TF-operator binding, but unaffected by varying the rate of TF-TF binding. Thus, varying the rate of TF-operator binding can drastically change the pathway of switching, while changing the rate of dimerization changes the switching rate without altering the mechanism. The switching pathways of the general switch are highly robust to changes in the rate constants of both TF-operator and TF-TF binding, even though these rate constants do affect the flipping rate; this feature is unique for nonequilibrium systems.},

title = {Estimation of macromolecule concentrations and excluded volume effects for the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli},
abstract = {The very high concentration of macromolecules within cells can potentially have an overwhelming effect on the thermodynamic activity of cellular components because of excluded volume effects. To estimate the magnitudes of such effects, we have made an experimental study of the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Parameters from cells and cell extracts are used to calculate approximate activity coefficients for cytoplasmic conditions. These calculations require a representation of the sizes, concentrations and effective specific volumes of the macromolecules in the extracts. Macromolecule size representations are obtained either by applying a two-phase distribution assay to define a related homogeneous solution or by using the molecular mass distribution of macromolecules from gel filtration. Macromolecule concentrations in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a correction for the dilution that occurs during extraction. That factor is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential or stationary growth phase are estimated to be approximately 0.3 to 0.4 g/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (lac repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications of the activity coefficients to solubility or to association reactions are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase and osmotic or other effects. The use of solutions of purified macromolecules that emulate the crowding conditions inferred for cytoplasm is discussed.},

In a living Escherichia coli cell, we directly observed specific binding of a lac repressor, labeled with a fluorescent protein, to a chromosomal lac operator. Using single-molecule detection techniques, we measured the kinetics of binding and dissociation of the repressor in response to metabolic signals. Furthermore, we characterized the nonspecific binding to DNA, one-dimensional (1D) diffusion along DNA segments, and 3D translocation among segments through cytoplasm at the single-molecule level. In searching for the operator, a lac repressor spends approximately 90% of time nonspecifically bound to and diffusing along DNA with a residence time of <5 milliseconds. The methods and findings can be generalized to other nucleic acid binding proteins.},

title = {Spatio-temporal correlations can drastically change the response of a MAPK pathway},
abstract = {Multisite covalent modification of proteins is omnipresent in eukaryotic cells. A well-known example is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade where, in each layer of the cascade, a protein is phosphorylated at two sites. It has long been known that the response of a MAPK pathway strongly depends on whether the enzymes that modify the protein act processively or distributively. A distributive mechanism, in which the enzyme molecules have to release the substrate molecules in between the modification of the two sites, can generate an ultrasensitive response and lead to hysteresis and bistability. We study by Green's Function Reaction Dynamics (GFRD), a stochastic scheme that makes it possible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level in time and space, a dual phosphorylation cycle in which the enzymes act according to a distributive mechanism. We find that the response of this network can differ dramatically from that predicted by a mean-field analysis based on the chemical rate equations. In particular, rapid rebindings of the enzyme molecules to the substrate molecules after modification of the first site can markedly speed up the response and lead to loss of ultrasensitivity and bistability. In essence, rapid enzyme-substrate rebindings can turn a distributive mechanism into a processive mechanism. We argue that slow ADP release by the enzymes can protect the system against these rapid rebindings, thus enabling ultrasensitivity and bistability.},

abstract = {The multistep character of transcription, translation, and protein modification inevitably leads to time delays between sensing gene regulatory signals and responding with changed concentrations of functional proteins. However, the interplay between the time-delayed and the stochastic nature of gene regulation has been poorly investigated. Here we present an extension of the linear noise approximation which makes it possible to estimate second moments--variances and covariances--of fluctuations around stationary states in time-delayed systems. The usefulness of the method is exemplified by analyzing two ubiquitous regulatory motifs. In the first system, we show that there is an optimal combination of transcriptional repression and direct product inhibition in determining the activity of an enzyme system. In particular, we demonstrate that direct product inhibition is necessary to avoid deleterious fluctuations in a system when the gene regulatory response is delayed. The second system is an anabolic motif where the substrate fluxes are balanced by time-delayed regulation responding to the substrate concentrations. The extended linear noise approximation makes it possible to show analytically that increased association rate between the substrates leads to a lower product flux because of increasing unbalance in substrate pools.},

However, for a receptor with more than one ligand binding site, the Hill equation does not reflect a physically possible reaction scheme; only under the very specific condition of marked positive cooperativity does the Hill coefficient accurately estimate the number of binding sites. The Hill coefficient is best thought of as an "interaction" coefficient, reflecting the extent of cooperativity among multiple ligand binding sites. Several relatively simple, physically plausible reaction schemes are shown here to produce a variety of ligand dose-response curve phenotypes more appropriately suited to modeling ligand-receptor interactions, especially if independent information about the stochiometry of the ligand-receptor interaction is available.},

This approach provides a biochemically and genetically consistent framework for the generation of hypotheses and the testing of functions of microbial cells.},

title = {Reaction-diffusion master equation, diffusion-limited reactions, and singular potentials},
abstract = {To model biochemical systems in which both noise in the chemical reaction process and spatial movement of molecules is important, both the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) and Smoluchowski diffusion-limited reaction (SDLR) partial differential equation (PDE) models have been used. In previous work we showed that the solution to the RDME may be interpreted as an asymptotic approximation in the reaction radius to the solution of the SDLR PDE [S. A. Isaacson, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 70, 77 (2009)]. The approximation was shown to be divergent in the limit that the lattice spacing in the RDME approached zero. In this work we expand upon these results for the special case of the two-molecule annihilation reaction, A+B-->{\O}. We first introduce a third stochastic reaction-diffusion PDE model that incorporates a pseudopotential based bimolecular reaction mechanism. The solution to the pseudopotential model is then shown to be an asymptotic approximation to the solution of the SDLR PDE for small reaction radii. We next illustrate how the RDME may be obtained by a formal discretization of the pseudopotential model, motivating why the RDME is itself an asymptotic approximation of the SDLR PDE. Finally, we give a more detailed numerical analysis of the difference between solutions to the RDME and SDLR PDE models as a function of both the reaction-radius and the lattice spacing (in the RDME).},

title = {Genomic characterization of methanomicrobiales reveals three classes of methanogens},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methanomicrobiales is the least studied order of methanogens. While these organisms appear to be more closely related to the Methanosarcinales in ribosomal-based phylogenetic analyses, they are metabolically more similar to Class I methanogens.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to improve our understanding of this lineage, we have completely sequenced the genomes of two members of this order, Methanocorpusculum labreanum Z and Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1, and compared them with the genome of a third, Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1. Similar to Class I methanogens, Methanomicrobiales use a partial reductive citric acid cycle for 2-oxoglutarate biosynthesis, and they have the Eha energy-converting hydrogenase. In common with Methanosarcinales, Methanomicrobiales possess the Ech hydrogenase and at least some of them may couple formylmethanofuran formation and heterodisulfide reduction to transmembrane ion gradients. Uniquely, M. labreanum and M. hungatei contain hydrogenases similar to the Pyrococcus furiosus Mbh hydrogenase, and all three Methanomicrobiales have anti-sigma factor and anti-anti-sigma factor regulatory proteins not found in other methanogens. Phylogenetic analysis based on seven core proteins of methanogenesis and cofactor biosynthesis places the Methanomicrobiales equidistant from Class I methanogens and Methanosarcinales.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that Methanomicrobiales, rather than being similar to Class I methanogens or Methanomicrobiales, share some features of both and have some unique properties. We find that there are three distinct classes of methanogens: the Class I methanogens, the Methanomicrobiales (Class II), and the Methanosarcinales (Class III).},

title = {Translational repression contributes greater noise to gene expression than transcriptional repression},
abstract = {Stochastic effects in gene expression may result in different physiological states of individual cells, with consequences for pathogen survival and artificial gene network design. We studied the contributions of a regulatory factor to gene expression noise in four basic mechanisms of negative gene expression control: 1), transcriptional regulation by a protein repressor, 2), translational repression by a protein; 3), transcriptional repression by RNA; and 4), RNA interference with the translation. We investigated a general model of a two-gene network, using the chemical master equation and a moment generating function approach. We compared the expression noise of genes with the same effective transcription and translation initiation rates resulting from the action of different repressors, whereas previous studies compared the noise of genes with the same mean expression level but different initiation rates. Our results show that translational repression results in a higher noise than repression on the promoter level, and that this relationship does not depend on quantitative parameter values. We also show that regulation of protein degradation contributes more noise than regulated degradation of mRNA. These are unexpected results, because previous investigations suggested that translational regulation is more accurate. The relative magnitude of the noise introduced by protein and RNA repressors depends on the protein and mRNA degradation rates, and we derived expressions for the threshold below which the noise introduced by a protein repressor is higher than the noise introduced by an RNA repressor.},

title = {The lac repressor},
abstract = {Few proteins have had such a strong impact on a field as the lac repressor has had in Molecular Biology. Over 40 years ago, Jacob and Monod [Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins, J. Mol. Biol. 3 (1961) 318] proposed a model for gene regulation, which survives essentially unchanged in contemporary textbooks. It is a cogent depiction of how a set of 'structural' genes may be coordinately transcribed in response to environmental conditions and regulates metabolic events in the cell. In bacteria, the genes required for lactose utilization are negatively regulated when a repressor molecule binds to an upstream cis activated operator. The repressor and its operator together form a genetic switch, the lac operon. The switch functions when inducer molecules alter the conformation of the repressor in a specific manner. In the presence of a particular metabolite, the repressor undergoes a conformational change that reduces its affinity for the operator. The structures of the lac repressor and its complexes with operator DNA and effector molecules have provided a physical platform for visualizing at the molecular level the different conformations the repressor and the molecular basis for the switch. The structures of lac repressor, bound to its operator and inducer, have also been invaluable for interpreting a plethora of biochemical and genetic data.},

Much less is clear in bacterial cells where the spatial distribution of mature mRNA remains ambiguous. Using a sensitive method based on quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show here that in Caulobacter crescentus and Escherichia coli, chromosomally expressed mRNAs largely display limited dispersion from their site of transcription during their lifetime. We estimate apparent diffusion coefficients at least two orders of magnitude lower than expected for freely diffusing mRNA, and provide evidence in C. crescentus that this mRNA localization restricts ribosomal mobility. Furthermore, C. crescentus RNase E appears associated with the DNA independently of its mRNA substrates. Collectively, our findings show that bacteria can spatially organize translation and, potentially, mRNA decay by using the chromosome layout as a template. This chromosome-centric organization has important implications for cellular physiology and for our understanding of gene expression in bacteria.},

title = {Dual feedback loops in the GAL regulon suppress cellular heterogeneity in yeast},
abstract = {Transcriptional noise is known to be an important cause of cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variation. The extent to which molecular interaction networks may have evolved to either filter or exploit transcriptional noise is a much debated question. The yeast genetic network regulating galactose metabolism involves two proteins, Gal3p and Gal80p, that feed back positively and negatively, respectively, on GAL gene expression. Using kinetic modeling and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these feedback interactions together are important for (i) controlling the cell-to-cell variability of GAL gene expression and (ii) ensuring that cells rapidly switch to an induced state for galactose uptake.},

title = {Absolute rate theories of epigenetic stability},
abstract = {Spontaneous switching events in most characterized genetic switches are rare, resulting in extremely stable epigenetic properties. We show how simple arguments lead to theories of the rate of such events much like the absolute rate theory of chemical reactions corrected by a transmission factor. Both the probability of the rare cellular states that allow epigenetic escape and the transmission factor depend on the rates of DNA binding and unbinding events and on the rates of protein synthesis and degradation. Different mechanisms of escape from the stable attractors occur in the nonadiabatic, weakly adiabatic, and strictly adiabatic regimes, characterized by the relative values of those input rates.},

abstract = {The tubulin-like FtsZ protein initiates assembly of the bacterial cytokinetic machinery by polymerizing into a ring structure, the Z ring, at the prospective site of division. To block Z-ring formation over the nucleoid and help coordinate cell division with chromosome segregation, Escherichia coli employs the nucleoid-associated division inhibitor, SlmA. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which SlmA regulates FtsZ assembly. We show that SlmA disassembles FtsZ polymers in vitro. In addition, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we identified 24 SlmA-binding sequences (SBSs) on the chromosome. Remarkably, SlmA binding to SBSs dramatically enhanced its ability to interfere with FtsZ polymerization, and ChIP studies indicate that SlmA regulates FtsZ assembly at these sites in vivo. Because of the dynamic and highly organized nature of the chromosome, coupling SlmA activation to specific DNA binding provides a mechanism for the precise spatiotemporal control of its anti-FtsZ activity within the cell.},

title = {Central Carbon Metabolism as a Minimal Biochemical Walk between Precursors for Biomass and Energy},
abstract = {Central carbon metabolism uses a complex series of enzymatic steps to convert sugars into metabolic precursors. These precursors are then used to generate the entire biomass of the cell. Are there simplifying principles that can explain the structure of such metabolic networks? Here we address this question by studying central carbon metabolism in E. coli. We use all known classes of enzymes that work on carbohydrates to generate rules for converting compounds and for generating possible paths between compounds. We find that central carbon metabolism is built as a minimal walk between the 12 precursor metabolites that form the basis for biomass and one precursor essential for the positive net ATP balance in glycolysis: every pair of consecutive precursors in the network is connected by the minimal number of enzymatic steps. Similarly, input sugars are converted into precursors by the shortest possible enzymatic paths. This suggests an optimality principle for the structure of central carbon metabolism. The present approach may be used to study other metabolic networks and to design new minimal pathways.},

title = {Enhancement of cellular memory by reducing stochastic transitions},
abstract = {On induction of cell differentiation, distinct cell phenotypes are encoded by complex genetic networks. These networks can prevent the reversion of established phenotypes even in the presence of significant fluctuations. Here we explore the key parameters that determine the stability of cellular memory by using the yeast galactose-signalling network as a model system. This network contains multiple nested feedback loops. Of the two positive feedback loops, only the loop mediated by the cytoplasmic signal transducer Gal3p is able to generate two stable expression states with a persistent memory of previous galactose consumption states. The parallel loop mediated by the galactose transporter Gal2p only increases the expression difference between the two states. A negative feedback through the inhibitor Gal80p reduces the strength of the core positive feedback. Despite this, a constitutive increase in the Gal80p concentration tunes the system from having destabilized memory to having persistent memory. A model reveals that fluctuations are trapped more efficiently at higher Gal80p concentrations. Indeed, the rate at which single cells randomly switch back and forth between expression states was reduced. These observations provide a quantitative understanding of the stability and reversibility of cellular differentiation states.},

The protein and DNA state dynamics are treated stochastically and on an equal footing. In this approach the mean influence of the proteomic cloud created by one gene on the action of another is self-consistently computed. Within this approximation a broad range of stochastic genetic switches may be solved exactly in terms of finding the probability distribution and its moments. A much larger class of problems, such as genetic networks and cascades, also remain exactly solvable with this approximation. We discuss, in depth, certain specific types of basic switches used by biological systems and compare their behavior to the expectation for a deterministic switch.},

title = {Metabolism of methanogens},
abstract = {Methanogenic archaea convert a few simple compounds such as H2 + CO2, formate, methanol, methylamines, and acetate to methane. Methanogenesis from all these substrates requires a number of unique coenzymes, some of which are exclusively found in methanogens. H2-dependent CO2 reduction proceeds via carrier-bound C1 intermediates which become stepwise reduced to methane. Methane formation from methanol and methylamines involves the disproportionation of the methyl groups. Part of the methyl groups are oxidized to CO2, and the reducing equivalents thereby gained are subsequently used to reduce other methyl groups to methane. This process involves the same C1 intermediates that are formed during methanogenesis from CO2. Conversion of acetate to methane and carbon dioxide is preceded by its activation to acetyl-CoA. Cleavage of the latter compound yields a coenzyme-bound methyl moiety and an enzyme-bound carbonyl group. The reducing equivalents gained by oxidation of the carbonyl group to carbon dioxide are subsequently used to reduce the methyl moiety to methane. All these processes lead to the generation of transmembrane ion gradients which fuel ATP synthesis via one or two types of ATP synthases. The synthesis of cellular building blocks starts with the central anabolic intermediate acetyl-CoA which, in autotrophic methanogens, is synthesized from two molecules of CO2 in a linear pathway.},

Deterministic chemical kinetics studied in the past has shown that bistability occurs in systems with strong (cubic) nonlinearity. For certain mesoscopic, weakly nonlinear (quadratic) biochemical reaction systems in a small volume, however, stochasticity can induce bistability and bifurcation that have no macroscopic counterpart. We report the simplest yet known reactions involving driven phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle kinetics with autocatalytic kinase. We show that the noise-induced phenomenon is correlated with free energy dissipation and thus conforms with the open-chemical system theory. A previous reported noise-induced bistability in futile cycles is found to have originated from the kinase synchronization in a bistable system with slow transitions, as reported here.},

title = {Symmetry breaking in the life cycle of the budding yeast},
abstract = {The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been an invaluable model system for the study of the establishment of cellular asymmetry and growth polarity in response to specific physiological cues. A large body of experimental observations has shown that yeast cells are able to break symmetry and establish polarity through two coupled and partially redundant intrinsic mechanisms, even in the absence of any pre-existing external asymmetry. One of these mechanisms is dependent upon interplay between the actin cytoskeleton and the Rho family GTPase Cdc42, whereas the other relies on a Cdc42 GTPase signaling network. Integral to these mechanisms appear to be positive feedback loops capable of amplifying small and stochastic asymmetries. Spatial cues, such as bud scars and pheromone gradients, orient cell polarity by modulating the regulation of the Cdc42 GTPase cycle, thereby biasing the site of asymmetry amplification.},

title = {Structured model of genetic control via the lac promoter in Escherichia coli},
abstract = {A model that describes induction of protein synthesis from lac-based promoters has been developed and incorporated into the single-cell model of Escherichia coli with transcriptional and translational modifications. Unlike previous models of lac-based promoters, this model allows a priori prediction of the intracellular parameters controlling transcription from lac-based promoters with only the extracellular levels of substrate and inducer as inputs. Because of the structural detail of the model, it is possible to simulate different genetic constructions for comparison, such as Lacl(q) strains versus wild-type cells, or including lacl on a multicopy plasmid. Expression from lac to tac promoters is predicted to yield 5% and 30% of the total cellular protein, respectively, with a pBR322-type plasmid. The model predicts the experimental observation that the Lacl(q) strain is not as fully induced as the wild-type strains, even at higher inducer concentrations. Additionally, the model predicts the right order of magnitude of protein production from lac and tac promoters when mechanisms for attenuation of transcription at lower translational efficiency are considered. Finally, the model predicts that for high copy number systems ribosomes become limiting in the synthesis of plasmid-encoded proteins. (c) 1994 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

title = {A new multicompartmental reaction-diffusion modeling method links transient membrane attachment of E. coli MinE to E-ring formation},
abstract = {Many important cellular processes are regulated by reaction-diffusion (RD) of molecules that takes place both in the cytoplasm and on the membrane. To model and analyze such multicompartmental processes, we developed a lattice-based Monte Carlo method, Spatiocyte that supports RD in volume and surface compartments at single molecule resolution. Stochasticity in RD and the excluded volume effect brought by intracellular molecular crowding, both of which can significantly affect RD and thus, cellular processes, are also supported. We verified the method by comparing simulation results of diffusion, irreversible and reversible reactions with the predicted analytical and best available numerical solutions. Moreover, to directly compare the localization patterns of molecules in fluorescence microscopy images with simulation, we devised a visualization method that mimics the microphotography process by showing the trajectory of simulated molecules averaged according to the camera exposure time. In the rod-shaped bacterium Escherichia coli, the division site is suppressed at the cell poles by periodic pole-to-pole oscillations of the Min proteins (MinC, MinD and MinE) arising from carefully orchestrated RD in both cytoplasm and membrane compartments. Using Spatiocyte we could model and reproduce the in vivo MinDE localization dynamics by accounting for the previously reported properties of MinE. Our results suggest that the MinE ring, which is essential in preventing polar septation, is largely composed of MinE that is transiently attached to the membrane independently after recruited by MinD. Overall, Spatiocyte allows simulation and visualization of complex spatial and reaction-diffusion mediated cellular processes in volumes and surfaces. As we showed, it can potentially provide mechanistic insights otherwise difficult to obtain experimentally.

title = {An efficient and exact stochastic simulation method to analyze rare events in biochemical systems},
abstract = {In robust biological systems, wide deviations from highly controlled normal behavior may be rare, yet they may result in catastrophic complications. While in silico analysis has gained an appreciation as a tool to offer insights into system-level properties of biological systems, analysis of such rare events provides a particularly challenging computational problem. This paper proposes an efficient stochastic simulation method to analyze rare events in biochemical systems. Our new approach can substantially increase the frequency of the rare events of interest by appropriately manipulating the underlying probability measure of the system, allowing high-precision results to be obtained with substantially fewer simulation runs than the conventional direct Monte Carlo simulation. Here, we show the algorithm of our new approach, and we apply it to the analysis of rare deviant transitions of two systems, resulting in several orders of magnitude speedup in generating high-precision estimates compared with the conventional Monte Carlo simulation.},

title = {Combinatorial transcriptional control of the lactose operon of Escherichia coli},
abstract = {The goal of systems biology is to understand the behavior of the whole in terms of knowledge of the parts. This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of Escherichia coli offers the possibility of confronting "system-level" properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

title = {Stochastic reaction-diffusion kinetics in the microscopic limit},
abstract = {Quantitative analysis of biochemical networks often requires consideration of both spatial and stochastic aspects of chemical processes. Despite significant progress in the field, it is still computationally prohibitive to simulate systems involving many reactants or complex geometries using a microscopic framework that includes the finest length and time scales of diffusion-limited molecular interactions. For this reason, spatially or temporally discretized simulations schemes are commonly used when modeling intracellular reaction networks. The challenge in defining such coarse-grained models is to calculate the correct probabilities of reaction given the microscopic parameters and the uncertainty in the molecular positions introduced by the spatial or temporal discretization. In this paper we have solved this problem for the spatially discretized Reaction-Diffusion Master Equation; this enables a seamless and physically consistent transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic frameworks of reaction-diffusion kinetics. We exemplify the use of the methods by showing that a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation motif, commonly observed in eukaryotic signaling pathways, is predicted to display fluctuations that depend on the geometry of the system.},

Exponential sensitivity limits the robustness of noise-driven switching, suggesting cells may use other mechanisms in order to switch reliably.

title = {Three-dimensional analysis of the structure and ecology of a novel, ultra-small archaeon},
abstract = {Fully understanding the biology of acid mine drainage (AMD) is central to our ability to control and manipulate its environmental impact. Although genomics and biogeochemical methods are relatively well established in the field, their combination with high-resolution imaging of intact members of microbial biofilm communities has not yet reached its full potential. Here, we used three-dimensional (3D) cryogenic electron tomography to determine the size and ultrastructure of intact ARMAN cells, a novel ultra-small archaeon, and sought evidence for their interactions with other members of its community. Within acid mine drainage biofilms, apparently free-living ARMAN cells from a deeply branched archaeal lineage have volumes of 0.009-0.04 microm(3) (mean approximately 0.03+/-0.01 microm(3)), only approximately 92 ribosomes, yet are frequent hosts for replicating viruses. Organization within the periplasm and partitioning of ribosomes to the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane may be factors in size minimization. Most cells contain enigmatic tubular structures of unknown function. The low ribosome copy number per unit volume, indicative of slow growth rates and targeting of cells by diverse viruses may account for the low abundance of ARMAN cells compared with other biofilm community members. Our results provide the first 3D analysis of structural features of these novel and enigmatic cells and their interactions with at least two types of viruses. Our findings also emphasize that new biological phenomena remain to be discovered among lower abundance organisms from novel uncultivated lineages.},

title = {Bridging the gap: linking molecular simulations and systemic descriptions of cellular compartments},
abstract = {Metabolic processes in biological cells are commonly either characterized at the level of individual enzymes and metabolites or at the network level. Often these two paradigms are considered as mutually exclusive because concepts from neither side are suited to describe the complete range of scales. Additionally, when modeling metabolic or regulatory cellular systems, often a large fraction of the required kinetic parameters are unknown. This even applies to such simple and extensively studied systems like the photosynthetic apparatus of purple bacteria. Using the chromatophore vesicles of Rhodobacter sphaeroides as a model system, we show that a consistent kinetic model emerges when fitting the dynamics of a molecular stochastic simulation to a set of time dependent experiments even though about two thirds of the kinetic parameters in this system are not known from experiment. Those kinetic parameters that were previously known all came out in the expected range. The simulation model was built from independent protein units composed of elementary reactions processing single metabolites. This pools-and-proteins approach naturally compiles the wealth of available molecular biological data into a systemic model and can easily be extended to describe other systems by adding new protein or nucleic acid types. The automated parameter optimization, performed with an evolutionary algorithm, reveals the sensitivity of the model to the value of each parameter and the relative importances of the experiments used. Such an analysis identifies the crucial system parameters and guides the setup of new experiments that would add most knowledge for a systemic understanding of cellular compartments. The successful combination of the molecular model and the systemic parametrization presented here on the example of the simple machinery for bacterial photosynthesis shows that it is actually possible to combine molecular and systemic modeling. This framework can now straightforwardly be applied to other currently less well characterized but biologically more relevant systems.},

abstract = {When gene regulatory networks operate in regimes where the number of protein molecules is so small that the molecular species are on the verge of extinction, the death and resurrection of the species greatly modifies the attractor landscape. Deterministic models and the diffusion approximation to the master equation break down at the limits of protein populations in a way very analogous to the breakdown of geometrical optics that occurs at distances <1 wavelength of light from edges. Stable stochastic attractors arise from extinction and resurrection events that are not predicted by the deterministic description. With this view, we explore the attractors of the regular toggle switch and the exclusive switch, focusing on the effects of cooperative binding and the production of protein in bursts. Our arguments suggest that the stability of lysogeny in the lambda-phage may be influenced by such extinction phenomena.},

title = {Top-down analysis of temporal hierarchy in biochemical reaction networks},
abstract = {The study of dynamic functions of large-scale biological networks has intensified in recent years. A critical component in developing an understanding of such dynamics involves the study of their hierarchical organization. We investigate the temporal hierarchy in biochemical reaction networks focusing on: (1) the elucidation of the existence of "pools" (i.e., aggregate variables) formed from component concentrations and (2) the determination of their composition and interactions over different time scales. To date the identification of such pools without prior knowledge of their composition has been a challenge. A new approach is developed for the algorithmic identification of pool formation using correlations between elements of the modal matrix that correspond to a pair of concentrations and how such correlations form over the hierarchy of time scales. The analysis elucidates a temporal hierarchy of events that range from chemical equilibration events to the formation of physiologically meaningful pools, culminating in a network-scale (dynamic) structure-(physiological) function relationship. This method is validated on a model of human red blood cell metabolism and further applied to kinetic models of yeast glycolysis and human folate metabolism, enabling the simplification of these models. The understanding of temporal hierarchy and the formation of dynamic aggregates on different time scales is foundational to the study of network dynamics and has relevance in multiple areas ranging from bacterial strain design and metabolic engineering to the understanding of disease processes in humans.},

title = {How do site-specific DNA-binding proteins find their targets?},
abstract = {Essentially all the biological functions of DNA depend on site-specific DNA-binding proteins finding their targets, and therefore 'searching' through megabases of non-target DNA. In this article, we review current understanding of how this sequence searching is done. We review how simple diffusion through solution may be unable to account for the rapid rates of association observed in experiments on some model systems, primarily the Lac repressor. We then present a simplified version of the 'facilitated diffusion' model of Berg, Winter and von Hippel, showing how non-specific DNA-protein interactions may account for accelerated targeting, by permitting the protein to sample many binding sites per DNA encounter. We discuss the 1-dimensional 'sliding' motion of protein along non-specific DNA, often proposed to be the mechanism of this multiple site sampling, and we discuss the role of short-range diffusive 'hopping' motions. We then derive the optimal range of sliding for a few physical situations, including simple models of chromosomes in vivo, showing that a sliding range of approximately 100 bp before dissociation optimizes targeting in vivo. Going beyond first-order binding kinetics, we discuss how processivity, the interaction of a protein with two or more targets on the same DNA, can reveal the extent of sliding and we review recent experiments studying processivity using the restriction enzyme EcoRV. Finally, we discuss how single molecule techniques might be used to study the dynamics of DNA site-specific targeting of proteins.},

title = {Spatial stochastic modelling of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase (PTS) pathway in Escherichia coli},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many biochemical networks involve reactions localized on the cell membrane. This can give rise to spatial gradients of the concentration of cytosolic species. Moreover, the number of membrane molecules can be small and stochastic effects can become relevant. Pathways usually consist of a complex interaction network and are characterized by a large set of parameters. The inclusion of spatial and stochastic effects is a major challenge in developing quantitative and dynamic models of pathways. RESULTS: We have developed a particle-based spatial stochastic method (GMP) to simulate biochemical networks in space, including fluctuations from the diffusion of particles and reactions. Gradients emerging from membrane reactions can be resolved. As case studies for the GMP method we used a simple gene expression system and the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system pathway. AVAILABILITY: The source code for the GMP method is available at http://www.science.uva.nl/research/scs/CellMath/GMP.},

title = {Separating forward and backward pathways in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling},
abstract = {Umbrella sampling enforces uniform sampling of steady-state distributions that are functions of arbitrary numbers of order parameters. The key to applying such methods to nonequilibrium processes is the accumulation of fluxes between regions. A significant difference between microscopically reversible and irreversible systems is that, in the latter case, the transition path ensemble for a reaction can be significantly different for "forward" and "backward" trajectories. Here, we show how to separately treat forward and backward pathways in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling simulations by working in an extended space. In this extended space, the exact rate (for equilibrium or nonequilibrium processes) can be calculated "for free" as a flux in phase space. We compare the efficiency of this rate calculation with forward flux sampling for a two-dimensional potential and show that nonequilibrium umbrella sampling is more efficient when an intermediate is present. We show that this technique can also be used to describe steady-state limit cycles by examining a simulation of circadian oscillations. We obtain the path of the limit cycle in a space of 22 order parameters, as well as the oscillation period. The relation of our method to others is discussed.},

title = {Connecting extracellular metabolomic measurements to intracellular flux states in yeast},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool in the quantitative identification of physiological and disease-induced biological states. Extracellular metabolome or metabolic profiling data, in particular, can provide an insightful view of intracellular physiological states in a noninvasive manner.

RESULTS: We used an updated genome-scale metabolic network model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, iMM904, to investigate how changes in the extracellular metabolome can be used to study systemic changes in intracellular metabolic states. The iMM904 metabolic network was reconstructed based on an existing genome-scale network, iND750, and includes 904 genes and 1,412 reactions. The network model was first validated by comparing 2,888 in silico single-gene deletion strain growth phenotype predictions to published experimental data. Extracellular metabolome data measured in response to environmental and genetic perturbations of ammonium assimilation pathways was then integrated with the iMM904 network in the form of relative overflow secretion constraints and a flux sampling approach was used to characterize candidate flux distributions allowed by these constraints. Predicted intracellular flux changes were consistent with published measurements on intracellular metabolite levels and fluxes. Patterns of predicted intracellular flux changes could also be used to correctly identify the regions of the metabolic network that were perturbed.

CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that integrating quantitative extracellular metabolomic profiles in a constraint-based framework enables inferring changes in intracellular metabolic flux states. Similar methods could potentially be applied towards analyzing biofluid metabolome variations related to human physiological and disease states.},

Here we will discuss efforts to make live-cell fluorescent microscopy based experiments using genetically encoded fluorescent reporters an automated, high throughput, and quantitative endeavor amenable to systems-level experiments in bacteria. We emphasize a quantitative data reduction approach, using simulation to help develop biologically relevant cell measurements that completely characterize the cell image.

abstract = {We directly observed real-time production of single protein molecules in individual Escherichia coli cells. A fusion protein of a fast-maturing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and a membrane-targeting peptide was expressed under a repressed condition. The membrane-localized YFP can be detected with single-molecule sensitivity. We found that the protein molecules are produced in bursts, with each burst originating from a stochastically transcribed single messenger RNA molecule, and that protein copy numbers in the bursts follow a geometric distribution. The quantitative study of low-level gene expression demonstrates the potential of single-molecule experiments in elucidating the workings of fundamental biological processes in living cells.},

title = {A diffusional bimolecular propensity function},
abstract = {We derive an explicit formula for the propensity function (stochastic reaction rate) of a generic bimolecular chemical reaction in which the reactant molecules move about by diffusion, as solute molecules in a bath of much smaller and more numerous solvent molecules. Our derivation assumes that the solution is macroscopically well stirred and dilute in the solute molecules. It effectively extends the physical rationale for the chemical master equation and the stochastic simulation algorithm from well-stirred dilute gases to well-stirred dilute solutions, with the former becoming a limiting case of the latter. This extension is important for cellular systems, where the solvent molecules are typically water and the solute (reactant) molecules are much larger organic structures, whose relatively low populations often require a discrete-stochastic formalism. In the course of our derivation, we illuminate some limitations on the ability of the classical diffusion equation to accurately describe how a diffusing molecule moves on spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to collision-induced chemical reactions.},

title = {Plasticity of the cis-regulatory input function of a gene},
abstract = {The transcription rate of a gene is often controlled by several regulators that bind specific sites in the gene's cis-regulatory region. The combined effect of these regulators is described by a cis-regulatory input function. What determines the form of an input function, and how variable is it with respect to mutations? To address this, we employ the well-characterized lac operon of Escherichia coli, which has an elaborate input function, intermediate between Boolean AND-gate and OR-gate logic. We mapped in detail the input function of 12 variants of the lac promoter, each with different point mutations in the regulator binding sites, by means of accurate expression measurements from living cells. We find that even a few mutations can significantly change the input function, resulting in functions that resemble Pure AND gates, OR gates, or single-input switches. Other types of gates were not found. The variant input functions can be described in a unified manner by a mathematical model. The model also lets us predict which functions cannot be reached by point mutations. The input function that we studied thus appears to be plastic, in the sense that many of the mutations do not ruin the regulation completely but rather result in new ways to integrate the inputs.},

title = {Global responses of Methanococcus maripaludis to specific nutrient limitations and growth rate},
abstract = {Continuous culture, transcriptome arrays, and measurements of cellular amino acid pools and tRNA charging levels were used to determine the response of Methanococcus maripaludis to leucine limitation. For comparison, the responses to phosphate and H2 limitations were measured as well. In addition, the effect of growth rate was determined. Leucine limitation resulted in a broad response. tRNA(Leu) charging decreased, but only small increases in mRNA were seen for amino acid biosynthesis genes. However, the cellular levels of free isoleucine and valine showed significant increases, indicating a coordinate regulation of branched-chain amino acids at a post-mRNA level. Leucine limitation also resulted in increased mRNA abundance for ribosomal protein genes, increased rRNA abundance, and decreased mRNA abundance for genes of methanogenesis. In contrast, phosphate limitation induced a specific response, a marked increase in mRNA levels for a phosphate transporter. Some mRNA levels responded to more than one factor; for example, transcripts for flagellum synthesis genes decreased under conditions of leucine limitation and increased under H2 limitation. Increased growth rate resulted in increased mRNA levels for ribosomal protein genes, increased rRNA abundance, and increased mRNA for a gene encoding an S-layer protein.},

title = {Binomial tau-leap spatial stochastic simulation algorithm for applications in chemical kinetics},
abstract = {In cell biology, cell signaling pathway problems are often tackled with deterministic temporal models, well mixed stochastic simulators, and/or hybrid methods. But, in fact, three dimensional stochastic spatial modeling of reactions happening inside the cell is needed in order to fully understand these cell signaling pathways. This is because noise effects, low molecular concentrations, and spatial heterogeneity can all affect the cellular dynamics. However, there are ways in which important effects can be accounted without going to the extent of using highly resolved spatial simulators (such as single-particle software), hence reducing the overall computation time significantly. We present a new coarse grained modified version of the next subvolume method that allows the user to consider both diffusion and reaction events in relatively long simulation time spans as compared with the original method and other commonly used fully stochastic computational methods. Benchmarking of the simulation algorithm was performed through comparison with the next subvolume method and well mixed models (MATLAB), as well as stochastic particle reaction and transport simulations (CHEMCELL, Sandia National Laboratories). Additionally, we construct a model based on a set of chemical reactions in the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway. For this particular application and a bistable chemical system example, we analyze and outline the advantages of our presented binomial tau-leap spatial stochastic simulation algorithm, in terms of efficiency and accuracy, in scenarios of both molecular homogeneity and heterogeneity.},

title = {Separating intrinsic from extrinsic fluctuations in dynamic biological systems},
abstract = {From molecules in cells to organisms in ecosystems, biological populations fluctuate due to the intrinsic randomness of individual events and the extrinsic influence of changing environments. The combined effect is often too complex for effective analysis, and many studies therefore make simplifying assumptions, for example ignoring either intrinsic or extrinsic effects to reduce the number of model assumptions. Here we mathematically demonstrate how two identical and independent reporters embedded in a shared fluctuating environment can be used to identify intrinsic and extrinsic noise terms, but also how these contributions are qualitatively and quantitatively different from what has been previously reported. Furthermore, we show for which classes of biological systems the noise contributions identified by dual-reporter methods correspond to the noise contributions predicted by correct stochastic models of either intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms. We find that for broad classes of systems, the extrinsic noise from the dual-reporter method can be rigorously analyzed using models that ignore intrinsic stochasticity. In contrast, the intrinsic noise can be rigorously analyzed using models that ignore extrinsic stochasticity only under very special conditions that rarely hold in biology. Testing whether the conditions are met is rarely possible and the dual-reporter method may thus produce flawed conclusions about the properties of the system, particularly about the intrinsic noise. Our results contribute toward establishing a rigorous framework to analyze dynamically fluctuating biological systems.},

Balancing these effects yields an optimal diffusion constant maximizing the precision of the expression domain.},

abstract = {Multistability, the capacity to achieve multiple internal states in response to a single set of external inputs, is the defining characteristic of a switch. Biological switches are essential for the determination of cell fate in multicellular organisms, the regulation of cell-cycle oscillations during mitosis and the maintenance of epigenetic traits in microbes. The multistability of several natural and synthetic systems has been attributed to positive feedback loops in their regulatory networks. However, feedback alone does not guarantee multistability. The phase diagram of a multistable system, a concise description of internal states as key parameters are varied, reveals the conditions required to produce a functional switch. Here we present the phase diagram of the bistable lactose utilization network of Escherichia coli. We use this phase diagram, coupled with a mathematical model of the network, to quantitatively investigate processes such as sugar uptake and transcriptional regulation in vivo. We then show how the hysteretic response of the wild-type system can be converted to an ultrasensitive graded response. The phase diagram thus serves as a sensitive probe of molecular interactions and as a powerful tool for rational network design.},

abstract = {The methanogenic bacterium strain G{\"o}1 harbors a high-molecular-weight enzyme complex containing methyl coenzyme M methylreductase as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy. This complex consists of a spherelike, hollow head piece, in the wall of which a number of copies of the methyl coenzyme M methylreductase are located. It is named Rc (c indicates collector). Intimately bound to it is a group of additional subunits of unknown composition referred to as Rm (m indicates mediator). Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples indicated that Rm contains a functional pore or channel which connects the internal volume of Rc with the outside. The RcRm complex is named Rs (s indicates spherelike). This complex was often found detached from the inside of the cytoplasmic membrane when membrane vesicles were investigated. However, Rs was also seen attached to a third component of the complex located in the membrane, the attachment being mediated by Rm. This membrane part of the complex is designated Rt (t indicates translocator). It consists of subunits with unknown composition. When Rs is attached to the membrane, the pore in Rm appears to be plugged by Rt. This indicates that the internal volume in Rc is in contact, via the pore in Rm, with Rt. The RcRmRt complex is referred to as methanoreductosome. Functional implications of the structural organization of the methylreductase system are discussed in view of methane formation and the creation of a transmembrane proton gradient used by the cell for ATP synthesis.},

title = {Robust spatial sensing of mating pheromone gradients by yeast cells},
abstract = {Projecting or moving up a chemical gradient is a universal behavior of living organisms. We tested the ability of S. cerevisiaea-cells to sense and respond to spatial gradients of the mating pheromone alpha-factor produced in a microfluidics chamber; the focus was on bar1Delta strains, which do not degrade the pheromone input. The yeast cells exhibited good accuracy with the mating projection typically pointing in the correct direction up the gradient ( approximately 80% under certain conditions), excellent sensitivity to shallow gradients, and broad dynamic range so that gradient-sensing was relatively robust over a 1000-fold range of average alpha-factor concentrations. Optimal directional sensing occurred at lower concentrations (5 nM) close to the K(d) of the receptor and with steeper gradient slopes. Pheromone supersensitive mutations (sst2Delta and ste2(300Delta)) that disrupt the down-regulation of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling caused defects in both sensing and response. Interestingly, yeast cells employed adaptive mechanisms to increase the robustness of the process including filamentous growth (i.e. directional distal budding) up the gradient at low pheromone concentrations, bending of the projection to be more aligned with the gradient, and forming a more accurate second projection when the first projection was in the wrong direction. Finally, the cells were able to amplify a shallow external gradient signal of alpha-factor to produce a dramatic polarization of signaling proteins at the front of the cell. Mathematical modeling revealed insights into the mechanism of this amplification and how the supersensitive mutants can disrupt accurate polarization. Together, these data help to specify and elucidate the abilities of yeast cells to sense and respond to spatial gradients of pheromone.},

title = {Tug-of-war as a cooperative mechanism for bidirectional cargo transport by molecular motors},
abstract = {Intracellular transport is based on molecular motors that pull cargos along cytoskeletal filaments. One motor species always moves in one direction, e.g., conventional kinesin moves to the microtubule plus end, whereas cytoplasmic dynein moves to the microtubule minus end. However, many cellular cargoes are observed to move bidirectionally, involving both plus- and minus-end-directed motors. The presumably simplest mechanism for such bidirectional transport is provided by a tug-of-war between the two motor species. This mechanism is studied theoretically using the load-dependent transport properties of individual motors as measured in single-molecule experiments. In contrast to previous expectations, such a tug-of-war is found to be highly cooperative and to exhibit seven different motility regimes depending on the precise values of the single motor parameters. The sensitivity of the transport process to small parameter changes can be used by the cell to regulate its cargo traffic.},

abstract = {The development of biomolecular devices that interface with biological systems to reveal new insights and produce novel functions is one of the defining goals of synthetic biology. Our lab previously described a synthetic, riboregulator system that affords for modular, tunable, and tight control of gene expression in vivo. Here we highlight several experimental advantages unique to this RNA-based system, including physiologically relevant protein production, component modularity, leakage minimization, rapid response time, tunable gene expression, and independent regulation of multiple genes. We demonstrate this utility in four sets of in vivo experiments with various microbial systems. Specifically, we show that the synthetic riboregulator is well suited for GFP fusion protein tracking in wild-type cells, tight regulation of toxic protein expression, and sensitive perturbation of stress response networks. We also show that the system can be used for logic-based computing of multiple, orthogonal inputs, resulting in the development of a programmable kill switch for bacteria. This work establishes a broad, easy-to-use synthetic biology platform for microbiology experiments and biotechnology applications.},

abstract = {Crystal structures of prokaryotic ribosomes have described in detail the universally conserved core of the translation mechanism. However, many facets of the translation process in eukaryotes are not shared with prokaryotes. The crystal structure of the yeast 80S ribosome determined at 4.15 angstrom resolution reveals the higher complexity of eukaryotic ribosomes, which are 40% larger than their bacterial counterparts. Our model shows how eukaryote-specific elements considerably expand the network of interactions within the ribosome and provides insights into eukaryote-specific features of protein synthesis. Our crystals capture the ribosome in the ratcheted state, which is essential for translocation of mRNA and transfer RNA (tRNA), and in which the small ribosomal subunit has rotated with respect to the large subunit. We describe the conformational changes in both ribosomal subunits that are involved in ratcheting and their implications in coordination between the two associated subunits and in mRNA and tRNA translocation.},

title = {Stochastic focusing: fluctuation-enhanced sensitivity of intracellular regulation},
abstract = {Many regulatory molecules are present in low copy numbers per cell so that significant random fluctuations emerge spontaneously. Because cell viability depends on precise regulation of key events, such signal noise has been thought to impose a threat that cells must carefully eliminate. However, the precision of control is also greatly affected by the regulatory mechanisms' capacity for sensitivity amplification. Here we show that even if signal noise reduces the capacity for sensitivity amplification of threshold mechanisms, the effect on realistic regulatory kinetics can be the opposite: stochastic focusing (SF). SF particularly exploits tails of probability distributions and can be formulated as conventional multistep sensitivity amplification where signal noise provides the degrees of freedom. When signal fluctuations are sufficiently rapid, effects of time correlations in signal-dependent rates are negligible and SF works just like conventional sensitivity amplification. This means that, quite counterintuitively, signal noise can reduce the uncertainty in regulated processes. SF is exemplified by standard hyperbolic inhibition, and all probability distributions for signal noise are first derived from underlying chemical master equations. The negative binomial is suggested as a paradigmatic distribution for intracellular kinetics, applicable to stochastic gene expression as well as simple systems with Michaelis-Menten degradation or positive feedback. SF resembles stochastic resonance in that noise facilitates signal detection in nonlinear systems, but stochastic resonance is related to how noise in threshold systems allows for detection of subthreshold signals and SF describes how fluctuations can make a gradual response mechanism work more like a threshold mechanism.},

We use the approach of maximum caliber, which computes the ensemble of paths taken by the system, given a few experimental observables. This approach may be useful for interpreting single-molecule or few-particle experiments on molecular motors, enzyme reactions, ion-channels, and phosphorylation-driven biological clocks. We consider cycles where all biochemical states are observable. Our method shows how: (1) the noise in cycles increases with cycle size and decreases with the driving force that spins the cycle and (2) provides a recipe for estimating small-number features, such as probability of backward spin in small cycles, from experimental data. The back-spin probability diminishes exponentially with the deviation from equilibrium. We believe this method may also be useful for other few-particle nonequilibrium biochemical reaction systems.},

title = {Regulation of noise in the expression of a single gene},
abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-lambda, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks and in the decrease of precision of cell signals. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

title = {Division accuracy in a stochastic model of Min oscillations in Escherichia coli},
abstract = {Accurate cell division in Escherichia coli requires the Min proteins MinC, MinD, and MinE as well as the presence of nucleoids. MinD and MinE exhibit spatial oscillations, moving from pole to pole of the bacterium, resulting in an average MinD concentration that is low at the center of the cell and high at the poles. This concentration minimum is thought to signal the site of cell division. Deterministic models of the Min oscillations reproduce many observed features of the system, including the concentration minimum of MinD. However, there are only a few thousand Min proteins in a bacterium, so stochastic effects are likely to play an important role. Here, we show that Monte Carlo simulations with a large number of proteins agree well with the results from a deterministic treatment of the equations. The location of minimum local MinD concentration is too variable to account for cell division accuracy in wild-type, but is consistent with the accuracy of cell division in cells without nucleoids. This finding confirms the need to include additional mechanisms, such as reciprocal interactions with the cell division ring or positioning of the nucleoids, to explain wild-type accuracy.},

title = {Simulating rare events in equilibrium or nonequilibrium stochastic systems},
abstract = {We present three algorithms for calculating rate constants and sampling transition paths for rare events in simulations with stochastic dynamics. The methods do not require a priori knowledge of the phase-space density and are suitable for equilibrium or nonequilibrium systems in stationary state. All the methods use a series of interfaces in phase space, between the initial and final states, to generate transition paths as chains of connected partial paths, in a ratchetlike manner. No assumptions are made about the distribution of paths at the interfaces. The three methods differ in the way that the transition path ensemble is generated. We apply the algorithms to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of a genetic switch and to Langevin dynamics simulations of intermittently driven polymer translocation through a pore. We find that the three methods are all of comparable efficiency, and that all the methods are much more efficient than brute-force simulation.},

The use of these models in combination with efficient search methods is discussed in the context of the so-called protein docking problem and in the description of weaker (i.e., noncrystallizable) protein-protein interactions. Finally, simulations of the dynamics of protein-protein association events are outlined.

title = {Linking high-resolution metabolic flux phenotypes and transcriptional regulation in yeast modulated by the global regulator Gcn4p},
abstract = {Genome sequencing dramatically increased our ability to understand cellular response to perturbation. Integrating system-wide measurements such as gene expression with networks of protein-protein interactions and transcription factor binding revealed critical insights into cellular behavior. However, the potential of systems biology approaches is limited by difficulties in integrating metabolic measurements across the functional levels of the cell despite their being most closely linked to cellular phenotype. To address this limitation, we developed a model-based approach to correlate mRNA and metabolic flux data that combines information from both interaction network models and flux determination models. We started by quantifying 5,764 mRNAs, 54 metabolites, and 83 experimental (13)C-based reaction fluxes in continuous cultures of yeast under stress in the absence or presence of global regulator Gcn4p. Although mRNA expression alone did not directly predict metabolic response, this correlation improved through incorporating a network-based model of amino acid biosynthesis (from r = 0.07 to 0.80 for mRNA-flux agreement). The model provides evidence of general biological principles: rewiring of metabolic flux (i.e., use of different reaction pathways) by transcriptional regulation and metabolite interaction density (i.e., level of pairwise metabolite-protein interactions) as a key biosynthetic control determinant. Furthermore, this model predicted flux rewiring in studies of follow-on transcriptional regulators that were experimentally validated with additional (13)C-based flux measurements. As a first step in linking metabolic control and genetic regulatory networks, this model underscores the importance of integrating diverse data types in large-scale cellular models. We anticipate that an integrated approach focusing on metabolic measurements will facilitate construction of more realistic models of cellular regulation for understanding diseases and constructing strains for industrial applications.},

abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that bistability (or, more generally, multistability) is an important recurring theme in cell signaling. Bistability may be of particular relevance to biological systems that switch between discrete states, generate oscillatory responses, or "remember" transitory stimuli. Standard mathematical methods allow the detection of bistability in some very simple feedback systems (systems with one or two proteins or genes that either activate each other or inhibit each other), but realistic depictions of signal transduction networks are invariably much more complex. Here, we show that for a class of feedback systems of arbitrary order the stability properties of the system can be deduced mathematically from how the system behaves when feedback is blocked. Provided that this open-loop, feedback-blocked system is monotone and possesses a sigmoidal characteristic, the system is guaranteed to be bistable for some range of feedback strengths. We present a simple graphical method for deducing the stability behavior and bifurcation diagrams for such systems and illustrate the method with two examples taken from recent experimental studies of bistable systems: a two-variable Cdc2/Wee1 system and a more complicated five-variable mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.},

title = {Stochastic models for regulatory networks of the genetic toggle switch},
abstract = {Bistability arises within a wide range of biological systems from the lambda phage switch in bacteria to cellular signal transduction pathways in mammalian cells. Changes in regulatory mechanisms may result in genetic switching in a bistable system. Recently, more and more experimental evidence in the form of bimodal population distributions indicates that noise plays a very important role in the switching of bistable systems. Although deterministic models have been used for studying the existence of bistability properties under various system conditions, these models cannot realize cell-to-cell fluctuations in genetic switching. However, there is a lag in the development of stochastic models for studying the impact of noise in bistable systems because of the lack of detailed knowledge of biochemical reactions, kinetic rates, and molecular numbers. In this work, we develop a previously undescribed general technique for developing quantitative stochastic models for large-scale genetic regulatory networks by introducing Poisson random variables into deterministic models described by ordinary differential equations. Two stochastic models have been proposed for the genetic toggle switch interfaced with either the SOS signaling pathway or a quorum-sensing signaling pathway, and we have successfully realized experimental results showing bimodal population distributions. Because the introduced stochastic models are based on widely used ordinary differential equation models, the success of this work suggests that this approach is a very promising one for studying noise in large-scale genetic regulatory networks.},

We show how the statistics of such systems can be mapped onto quantum many-body problems. The dynamics of a single gene switch resembles the spin-boson model of a two-site polaron or an electron transfer reaction. Networks of switches can be approximately described as quantum spin systems by using an appropriate variational principle. In this way, the concept of frustration for magnetic systems can be taken over into gene networks. The landscape of stable attractors depends on the degree and style of frustration, much as for neural networks. We show the number of attractors, which may represent cell types, is much smaller for appropriately designed weakly frustrated stochastic networks than for randomly connected networks.},

abstract = {A classic problem in population and evolutionary biology is to understand how a population optimizes its fitness in fluctuating environments. A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

To evaluate the translation state of an mRNA, ribosomal subunits, ribosomes, and polysomes can be isolated from detergent-treated cell extracts by high-speed differential centrifugation. These ribonucleoprotein complexes can be further purified by centrifugation through sucrose density gradients. By fractionation of the gradient the amount of an individual mRNA in a sub-population of polysomes can be quantitatively determined. Here, we describe methods for the isolation and quantification of polysome complexes from plant tissues. The mRNA obtained can be further analyzed by methods that evaluate polysomal mRNA abundance at the individual transcript or global level. A modification of the conventional polysome isolation procedure is described for transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana that express an epitope-tagged version of ribosomal protein L18 (RPL18) that facilitates capture of ribosomes from crude cell extracts by a one-step immunoprecipitation method.},

abstract = {A major goal of developmental biology is to understand the molecular mechanisms whereby genetic signaling networks establish and maintain distinct cell types within multicellular organisms. Here, we review cell-fate decisions in the developing eye of Drosophila melanogaster and the experimental results that have revealed the topology of the underlying signaling circuitries. We then propose that switch-like network motifs based on positive feedback play a central role in cell-fate choice, and discuss how mathematical modeling can be used to understand and predict the bistable or multistable behavior of such networks.},

By enforcing equal sampling of different regions of phase space, as in umbrella sampling simulations of systems at equilibrium, low probability regions are explored to a much greater extent than in physically weighted simulations. The algorithm can be used to accumulate joint statistics for an arbitrary number of order parameters for a system governed by any stochastic dynamics. They demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm by applying it to a model of a genetic toggle switch which evolves irreversibly according to a continuous time Monte Carlo procedure.},

title = {Distinct regulators control the expression of methanol methyltransferase isozymes in Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A},
abstract = {The mtaCB1, mtaCB2 and mtaCB3 operons encode isozymes of methanol methyltransferases in Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A and are among the most highly regulated genes known in Archaea. Here we identify cis and trans acting elements that affect the expression of these operons. In vivo reporter gene constructs expressed from sequentially truncated promoters show that the mRNA transcripts for these operons have large 5' untranslated regions. Regions upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) are important for induction of the mtaCB1 and mtaCB2 operons and for repression of the mtaCB3. Regions downstream of the TSS are important for expression of the mtaCB2 and mtaCB3 operons, but are dispensable for mtaCB1 expression. Proteins encoded by the MA0459 and MA0460 loci are required for induction of the mtaCB1 operon, while those encoded by MA4383, MA4397 and MA4398 are required for induction of mtaCB2. Proteins encoded by MA4397 and MA4398 are also required for methanol-specific repression of the mtaCB3 operon and, thus, are the first archaeal examples of regulatory proteins that simultaneously act in both repression and activation. We refer to these genes as methanol-specific regulators and designate MA0459, MA0460, MA4383, MA4397 and MA4398 as msrA, msrB, msrC, msrD and msrE respectively.},

title = {Colored extrinsic fluctuations and stochastic gene expression},
abstract = {Stochasticity is both exploited and controlled by cells. Although the intrinsic stochasticity inherent in biochemistry is relatively well understood, cellular variation, or 'noise', is predominantly generated by interactions of the system of interest with other stochastic systems in the cell or its environment. Such extrinsic fluctuations are nonspecific, affecting many system components, and have a substantial lifetime, comparable to the cell cycle (they are 'colored'). Here, we extend the standard stochastic simulation algorithm to include extrinsic fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations affect mean protein numbers and intrinsic noise, can speed up typical network response times, and can explain trends in high-throughput measurements of variation. If extrinsic fluctuations in two components of the network are correlated, they may combine constructively (amplifying each other) or destructively (attenuating each other). Consequently, we predict that incoherent feedforward loops attenuate stochasticity, while coherent feedforwards amplify it. Our results demonstrate that both the timescales of extrinsic fluctuations and their nonspecificity substantially affect the function and performance of biochemical networks.},

title = {Signal transduction cascades regulating fungal development and virulence},
abstract = {Cellular differentiation, mating, and filamentous growth are regulated in many fungi by environmental and nutritional signals. For example, in response to nitrogen limitation, diploid cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergo a dimorphic transition to filamentous growth referred to as pseudohyphal differentiation. Yeast filamentous growth is regulated, in part, by two conserved signal transduction cascades: a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and a G-protein regulated cyclic AMP signaling pathway. Related signaling cascades play an analogous role in regulating mating and virulence in the plant fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis and the human fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans. We review here studies on the signaling cascades that regulate development of these and other fungi. This analysis illustrates both how the model yeast S. cerevisiae can serve as a paradigm for signaling in other organisms and also how studies in other fungi provide insights into conserved signaling pathways that operate in many divergent organisms.},

title = {Functional genomics: expression analysis of Escherichia coli growing on minimal and rich media},
abstract = {DNA arrays of the entire set of Escherichia coli genes were used to measure the genomic expression patterns of cells growing in late logarithmic phase on minimal glucose medium and on Luria broth containing glucose. Ratios of the transcript levels for all 4,290 E. coli protein-encoding genes (cds) were obtained, and analysis of the expression ratio data indicated that the physiological state of the cells under the two growth conditions could be ascertained. The cells in the rich medium grew faster, and expression of the majority of the translation apparatus genes was significantly elevated under this growth condition, consistent with known patterns of growth rate-dependent regulation and increased rate of protein synthesis in rapidly growing cells. The cells grown on minimal medium showed significantly elevated expression of many genes involved in biosynthesis of building blocks, most notably the amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Nearly half of the known RpoS-dependent genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in minimal medium than in rich medium, and rpoS expression was similarly elevated. The role of RpoS regulation in these logarithmic phase cells was suggested by the functions of the RpoS dependent genes that were induced. The hallmark features of E. coli cells growing on glucose minimal medium appeared to be the formation and excretion of acetate, metabolism of the acetate, and protection of the cells from acid stress. A hypothesis invoking RpoS and UspA (universal stress protein, also significantly elevated in minimal glucose medium) as playing a role in coordinating these various aspects and consequences of glucose and acetate metabolism was generated. This experiment demonstrates that genomic expression assays can be applied in a meaningful way to the study of whole-bacterial-cell physiology for the generation of hypotheses and as a guide for more detailed studies of particular genes of interest.},

title = {Fundamental limits on the suppression of molecular fluctuations},
abstract = {Negative feedback is common in biological processes and can increase a system's stability to internal and external perturbations. But at the molecular level, control loops always involve signalling steps with finite rates for random births and deaths of individual molecules. Here we show, by developing mathematical tools that merge control and information theory with physical chemistry, that seemingly mild constraints on these rates place severe limits on the ability to suppress molecular fluctuations. Specifically, the minimum standard deviation in abundances decreases with the quartic root of the number of signalling events, making it extremely expensive to increase accuracy. Our results are formulated in terms of experimental observables, and existing data show that cells use brute force when noise suppression is essential; for example, regulatory genes are transcribed tens of thousands of times per cell cycle. The theory challenges conventional beliefs about biochemical accuracy and presents an approach to the rigorous analysis of poorly characterized biological systems.},

Correspondingly, there is considerable interest in understanding how different molecular mechanisms of gene expression impact variations in protein levels across a population of cells. In this work, we analyze a stochastic model of bursty gene expression which considers general waiting-time distributions governing arrival and decay of proteins. By mapping the system to models analyzed in queueing theory, we derive analytical expressions for the noise in steady-state protein distributions. The derived results extend previous work by including the effects of arbitrary probability distributions representing the effects of molecular memory and bursting. The analytical expressions obtained provide insight into the role of transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational mechanisms in controlling the noise in gene expression.},

abstract = {Methanogens catalyze the hydrogen-dependent eight-electron reduction of carbon dioxide to methane. Two of the key catalysts in the eight-electron reduction pathway are the nickel-containing enzymes F420-reducing hydrogenase and methyl reductase. In the present study, the structures of these archaebacterial enzymes from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H have been determined by electron microscopy. By negative stain techniques, F420 hydrogenase was found to be a ring structure with a diameter of 15.7 nm and an inner channel 4 nm in diameter. Shadow-casting experiments demonstrated that the rings were 8.5 nm deep, indicating a holoenzyme molecular weight of 8.0 X 10(5). Methyl reductase appeared to be an oligomeric complex of dimensions 8.5 by 9 by 11 nm, with a central stain-penetrating region. The morphology and known subunit composition suggest a model in which the subunits are arranged as an eclipsed pair of open trimers. Methyl reductase was also found in the form of larger aggregates and in paracrystalline arrays derived from highly concentrated solutions. The extremely large size of F420 hydrogenase and the methyl reductase supramolecular assemblies may have relevance in vivo in the construction of multiprotein arrays that function in methane biogenesis.},

In this review we focus on the MatP, SeqA, and SlmA proteins that have recently been identified as the first examples of factors with macrodomain-specific DNA-binding properties. In particular, we review the evidence that these factors contribute towards the control of chromosome replication and segregation by specifically targeting subregions of the genome and contributing towards their unique properties. Genome sequence analysis of multiple related bacteria, including pathogenic species, reveals that macrodomain-specific distribution of SeqA, SlmA, and MatP is conserved, suggesting common principles of chromosome organisation in these organisms. This discovery of proteins with macrodomain-specific binding properties hints that there are other proteins with similar specificity yet to be unveiled. We discuss the roles of the proteins identified to date as well as strategies that may be employed to discover new factors.},

abstract = {We introduce a powerful method for exploring the properties of the multidimensional free energy surfaces (FESs) of complex many-body systems by means of coarse-grained non-Markovian dynamics in the space defined by a few collective coordinates. A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.},

title = {Absolute protein-protein association rate constants from flexible, coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations: the role of intermolecular hydrodynamic interactions in barnase-barstar association},
abstract = {Theory and computation have long been used to rationalize the experimental association rate constants of protein-protein complexes, and Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations, in particular, have been successful in reproducing the relative rate constants of wild-type and mutant protein pairs. Missing from previous BD studies of association kinetics, however, has been the description of hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) between, and within, the diffusing proteins. Here we address this issue by rigorously including HIs in BD simulations of the barnase-barstar association reaction. We first show that even very simplified representations of the proteins--involving approximately one pseudoatom for every three residues in the protein--can provide excellent reproduction of the absolute association rate constants of wild-type and mutant protein pairs. We then show that simulations that include intermolecular HIs also produce excellent estimates of association rate constants, but, for a given reaction criterion, yield values that are decreased by ∼35-80% relative to those obtained in the absence of intermolecular HIs. The neglect of intermolecular HIs in previous BD simulation studies, therefore, is likely to have contributed to the somewhat overestimated absolute rate constants previously obtained. Consequently, intermolecular HIs could be an important component to include in accurate modeling of the kinetics of macromolecular association events.},

title = {Stochastic simulation of chemical reactions with spatial resolution and single molecule detail},
abstract = {Methods are presented for simulating chemical reaction networks with a spatial resolution that is accurate to nearly the size scale of individual molecules. Using an intuitive picture of chemical reaction systems, each molecule is treated as a point-like particle that diffuses freely in three-dimensional space. When a pair of reactive molecules collide, such as an enzyme and its substrate, a reaction occurs and the simulated reactants are replaced by products. Achieving accurate bimolecular reaction kinetics is surprisingly difficult, requiring a careful consideration of reaction processes that are often overlooked. This includes whether the rate of a reaction is at steady-state and the probability that multiple reaction products collide with each other to yield a back reaction. Inputs to the simulation are experimental reaction rates, diffusion coefficients and the simulation time step. From these are calculated the simulation parameters, including the 'binding radius' and the 'unbinding radius', where the former defines the separation for a molecular collision and the latter is the initial separation between a pair of reaction products. Analytic solutions are presented for some simulation parameters while others are calculated using look-up tables. Capabilities of these methods are demonstrated with simulations of a simple bimolecular reaction and the Lotka-Volterra system.},

title = {Life close to the thermodynamic limit: how methanogenic archaea conserve energy},
abstract = {Methane-forming archaea are strictly anaerobic, ancient microbes that are widespread in nature. These organisms are commonly found in anaerobic environments such as rumen, anaerobic sediments of rivers and lakes, hyperthermal deep sea vents and even hypersaline environments. From an evolutionary standpoint they are close to the origin of life. Common to all methanogens is the biological production of methane by a unique pathway currently only found in archaea. Methanogens can grow on only a limited number of substrates such as H(2) + CO(2), formate, methanol and other methyl group-containing substrates and some on acetate. The free energy change associated with methanogenesis from these compounds allows for the synthesis of 1 (acetate) to a maximum of only 2 mol of ATP under standard conditions while under environmental conditions less than one ATP can be synthesized. Therefore, methanogens live close to the thermodynamic limit. To cope with this problem, they have evolved elaborate mechanisms of energy conservation using both protons and sodium ions as the coupling ion in one pathway. These energy conserving mechanisms are comprised of unique enzymes, cofactors and electron carriers present only in methanogens. This review will summarize the current knowledge of energy conservation of methanogens and focus on recent insights into structure and function of ion translocating enzymes found in these organisms.},

title = {Stochastic modelling of reaction-diffusion processes: algorithms for bimolecular reactions},
abstract = {Several stochastic simulation algorithms (SSAs) have recently been proposed for modelling reaction-diffusion processes in cellular and molecular biology. In this paper, two commonly used SSAs are studied. The first SSA is an on-lattice model described by the reaction-diffusion master equation. The second SSA is an off-lattice model based on the simulation of Brownian motion of individual molecules and their reactive collisions. In both cases, it is shown that the commonly used implementation of bimolecular reactions (i.e. the reactions of the form A + B --> C or A + A --> C) might lead to incorrect results. Improvements of both SSAs are suggested which overcome the difficulties highlighted. In particular, a formula is presented for the smallest possible compartment size (lattice spacing) which can be correctly implemented in the first model. This implementation uses a new formula for the rate of bimolecular reactions per compartment (lattice site).},

The turnover number and the half-saturation constant for transport agree with the values known for cells. This result demonstrates that lactose permease is the sole protein necessary for galactoside transport. Furthermore, lactose permease seems not to require a high level of negatively charged lipids or a certain degree of unsaturation of the lipid hydrocarbon chains. However, the lipids must be in the fluid state, because the transport rate drastically decreases below the lipid ordered fluid phase transition.},

Often, this organization takes place in the presence of strong random fluctuations due to the small number of molecules involved.

A computational model provides strong evidence that the macroscopic switching is rooted in microscopic noise on the molecular scale. In longer bacteria, the switching turns into regular oscillations that are required for positioning of the division plane. As the pattern becomes more regular, cell-to-cell variability also lessens, indicating cell length-dependent regulation of Min-protein activity.},

title = {Structural and physical aspects of bacterial chromosome segregation},
abstract = {Microscopic observations on the bacterial nucleoid suggest that the chromosome occurs in the cell as a compact nucleoid phase separate from the cytoplasm. Physical theory likewise predicts a phase separation, taking into consideration DNA supercoiling, nucleoid-binding proteins, and excluded-volume interactions between DNA and cytoplasmic proteins. Specific DNA loci, visualized as oriC-GFP spots in the densely packed nucleoid, exhibit a very low diffusion coefficient indicating that they are virtually immobile and may primarily be moved by overall length growth. Such gradual movement could be effectuated by replication, transertion (combined transcription, translation, and insertion of proteins), and actin- (MreB) directed surface synthesis. Differences in the movement and positioning of gene loci between Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus are discussed. We propose that a low diffusion coefficient could explain the linear positioning of genes in the nucleoid and that differential transcriptional activity could induce different mobilities between either replichores (E. coli) or daughter strands (C. crescentus). The transertion process, possibly in combination with MreB cytoskeletal tracks, could overcome the compaction forces and move specific chromosomal regions and the nucleoid as a whole without invoking a dedicated mechanism.},

title = {Flexibility in the inducer binding region is crucial for allostery in the Escherichia coli lactose repressor},
abstract = {Lactose repressor protein (LacI) utilizes an allosteric mechanism to regulate transcription in Escherichia coli, and the transition between inducer- and operator-bound states has been simulated by targeted molecular dynamics (TMD). The side chains of amino acids 149 and 193 interact and were predicted by TMD simulation to play a critical role in the early stages of the LacI conformational change. D149 contacts IPTG directly, and variations at this site provide the opportunity to dissect its role in inducer binding and signal transduction. Single mutants at D149 or S193 exhibit a minimal change in operator binding, and alterations in inducer binding parallel changes in operator release, indicating normal allosteric response. The observation that the double mutant D149A/S193A exhibits wild-type properties excludes the requirement for inter-residue hydrogen bond formation in the allosteric response. The double mutant D149C/S193C purified from cell extracts shows decreased sensitivity to inducer binding while retaining wild-type binding affinities and kinetic constants for both operator and inducer. By manipulating cysteine oxidation, we show that the more reduced state of D149C/S193C responds to inducer more like the wild-type protein, whereas the more oxidized state displays diminished inducer sensitivity. These features of D149C/S193C indicate that the novel disulfide bond formed in this mutant impedes the allosteric transition, consistent with the role of this region predicted by TMD simulation. Together, these results establish the requirement for flexibility in the spatial relationship between D149 and S193 rather than a specific D149-S193 interaction in the LacI allosteric response to inducer.},

title = {The effect of transcription and translation initiation frequencies on the stochastic fluctuations in prokaryotic gene expression},
abstract = {The kinetics of prokaryotic gene expression has been modelled by the Monte Carlo computer simulation algorithm of Gillespie, which allowed the study of random fluctuations in the number of protein molecules during gene expression. The model, when applied to the simulation of LacZ gene expression, is in good agreement with experimental data. The influence of the frequencies of transcription and translation initiation on random fluctuations in gene expression has been studied in a number of simulations in which promoter and ribosome binding site effectiveness has been changed in the range of values reported for various prokaryotic genes. We show that the genes expressed from strong promoters produce the protein evenly, with a rate that does not vary significantly among cells. The genes with very weak promoters express the protein in "bursts" occurring at random time intervals. Therefore, if the low level of gene expression results from the low frequency of transcription initiation, huge fluctuations arise. In contrast, the protein can be produced with a low and uniform rate if the gene has a strong promoter and a slow rate of ribosome binding (a weak ribosome binding site). The implications of these findings for the expression of regulatory proteins are discussed.},

title = {Stochastic mechanisms in gene expression},
abstract = {In cellular regulatory networks, genetic activity is controlled by molecular signals that determine when and how often a given gene is transcribed. In genetically controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such "genetically coupled" link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths. The result can be a partitioning of the cell population into different phenotypes as the cells follow different paths. There are numerous unexplained examples of phenotypic variations in isogenic populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may be the result of these stochastic gene expression mechanisms.},

abstract = {The combination of the capabilities of light microscopical techniques with the power of resolution of electron microscopy along with technical advances has led to a gradual decline of the gap between classical light and electron microscopy. Among the correlative techniques using the synergistic opportunities, photooxidation methods have been established as valuable tools for visualizing cell structures at both light and electron microscopic level. Fluorescent dyes are used to oxidize the substrate diaminobenzidine, which in its oxidized state forms fine granular precipitates. Stained with osmium, the diaminobenzidine precipitates are well discernible in the electron microscope, thus labelling and defining the cellular structures, which at light microscopy level are recorded by fluorescent probes. The underlying photooxidation reaction is based on the excitation of free oxygen radicals that form upon illumination of fluorochromes; this is a central step in the procedure, which mainly influences the success of the method. This article summarizes basic steps of the technology and progresses, shows efforts and elaborated pathways, and focuses on methodical solutions as to the applicability of different fluorochromes, as well as conditions for fine structural localizations of the reaction products.},

title = {Intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to stochasticity in gene expression},
abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

title = {Kinetic paths, time scale, and underlying landscapes: a path integral framework to study global natures of nonequilibrium systems and networks},
abstract = {We developed a general framework to quantify three key ingredients for dynamics of nonequilibrium systems through path integrals in length space. First, we identify dominant kinetic paths as the ones with optimal weights, leading to effective reduction of dimensionality or degrees of freedom from exponential to polynomial so large systems can be treated. Second, we uncover the underlying nonequilibrium potential landscapes from the explorations of the state space through kinetic paths. We apply our framework to a specific example of nonequilibrium network system: lambda phage genetic switch. Two distinct basins of attractions emerge. The dominant kinetic paths from one basin to another are irreversible and do not follow the usual steepest descent or gradient path along the landscape. It reflects the fact that the dynamics of nonequilibrium systems is not just determined by potential gradient but also the residual curl flux force, suggesting experiments to test theoretical predictions. Third, we have calculated dynamic transition time scales from one basin to another critical for stability of the system through instantons. Theoretical predictions are in good agreements with wild type and mutant experiments. We further uncover the correlations between the kinetic transition time scales and the underlying landscape topography: the barrier heights along the dominant paths. We found that both the dominant paths and the landscape are relatively robust against the influences of external environmental perturbations and the system tends to dissipate less with less fluctuations. Our general framework can be applied to other nonequilibrium systems.},

To monitor transcription at high temporal resolution, we established various gene trap cell lines and transgenic cell lines expressing a short-lived luciferase protein from an unstable mRNA, and recorded bioluminescence in real time in single cells. Mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on- and off-switching rates in transcriptional activity and mean numbers of mRNAs produced during the bursts. Transcriptional kinetics were markedly altered by cis-regulatory DNA elements. Our analysis demonstrated that bursting kinetics are highly gene-specific, reflecting refractory periods during which genes stay inactive for a certain time before switching on again.},

title = {Stochastic gene expression in fluctuating environments},
abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms can cause a group of isogenic bacteria, each subject to identical environmental conditions, to nevertheless exhibit diverse patterns of gene expression. The resulting phenotypic subpopulations will typically have distinct growth rates. This behavior has been observed in several contexts, including sugar metabolism and pili phase variation. Under fixed environmental conditions, the net growth rate of the population is maximized when all cells are of the fastest growing phenotype, so it is unclear what fitness advantage is conferred by population heterogeneity. However, unlike ideal laboratory conditions, natural environments tend to fluctuate, either periodically or randomly. Here we use a stochastic population model to show that, during growth in such fluctuating environments, a dynamically heterogenous bacterial population can sometimes achieve a higher net growth rate than a homogenous one. By using stochastic mechanisms to sample several distinct phenotypes, the bacteria are able to anticipate and take advantage of sudden changes in their environment. However, this heterogeneity is beneficial only if the bacterial response rate is sufficiently low. Our results could be useful in the design of artificial evolution experiments and in the optimization of fermentation processes.},

title = {Diffusion of transcription factors can drastically enhance the noise in gene expression},
abstract = {We study by Green's Function Reaction Dynamics the effect of the diffusive motion of repressor molecules on the noise in mRNA and protein levels for a gene that is under the control of a repressor. We find that spatial fluctuations due to diffusion can drastically enhance the noise in gene expression. After dissociation from the operator, a repressor can rapidly rebind to the DNA. Our results show that the rebinding trajectories are so short that, on this timescale, the RNA polymerase (RNAP) cannot effectively compete with the repressor for binding to the promoter. As a result, a dissociated repressor molecule will on average rebind many times, before it eventually diffuses away. These rebindings thus lower the effective dissociation rate, and this increases the noise in gene expression. Another consequence of the timescale separation between repressor rebinding and RNAP association is that the effect of spatial fluctuations can be described by a well-stirred, zero-dimensional, model by renormalizing the reaction rates for repressor-DNA (un) binding. Our results thus support the use of well-stirred, zero-dimensional models for describing noise in gene expression. We also show that for a fixed repressor strength, the noise due to diffusion can be minimized by increasing the number of repressors or by decreasing the rate of the open complex formation. Lastly, our results emphasize that power spectra are a highly useful tool for studying the propagation of noise through the different stages of gene expression.},

abstract = {Transcription in eukaryotic cells has been described as quantal, with pulses of messenger RNA produced in a probabilistic manner. This description reflects the inherently stochastic nature of gene expression, known to be a major factor in the heterogeneous response of individual cells within a clonal population to an inducing stimulus. Here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that stochasticity (noise) arising from transcription contributes significantly to the level of heterogeneity within a eukaryotic clonal population, in contrast to observations in prokaryotes, and that such noise can be modulated at the translational level. We use a stochastic model of transcription initiation specific to eukaryotes to show that pulsatile mRNA production, through reinitiation, is crucial for the dependence of noise on transcriptional efficiency, highlighting a key difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources of noise. Furthermore, we explore the propagation of noise in a gene cascade network and demonstrate experimentally that increased noise in the transcription of a regulatory protein leads to increased cell-cell variability in the target gene output, resulting in prolonged bistable expression states. This result has implications for the role of noise in phenotypic variation and cellular differentiation.},

abstract = {Immunoaffinity purification of polyribosomes (polysomes) from crude leaf extracts of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was achieved with transgenic genotypes that overexpress a translational fusion of a ribosomal protein (RP) with a His(6)-FLAG dual epitope tag. In plants with a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S:HF-RPL18 transgene immunopurification with anti-FLAG agarose beads yielded 60-Svedberg ribosomal subunits, intact 80-Svedberg monosomes and polysomes. Sucrose density gradient fractionation of the purified complexes demonstrated that the distribution of polysome size was similar in crude cell extracts and the purified complexes. The immunopurified complexes included putative cytosolic RPs of Arabidopsis and ribosome-associated proteins, as well as full-length transcripts of high and low abundance. Whole-genome profiling using long DNA oligonucleotide-based microarrays provided a high level of reproducibility between polysomal mRNA samples immunopurified from two independent biological replicates (r approximately 0.90). Comparison of immunopurified and total cellular RNA samples revealed that for most of the genes, the mRNAs were associated with the epitope-tagged polysomal complexes, with an average relative level of association of 62.06% +/- 4.39%. The results demonstrate that the immunopurification of polysomes can be a valuable tool for the quantification of mRNAs present in translation complexes in plant cells. This technology can be extended to evaluation of mRNA populations at the cell- or tissue-specific level by regulation of the tagged RP with distinct promoters.},

abstract = {Many fungi undergo a developmental transition from a unicellular yeast form to an invasive filamentous form in response to environmental cues. Here we describe a quorum signaling pathway that links environmental sensing to morphogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Saccharomyces cells secrete aromatic alcohols that stimulate morphogenesis by inducing the expression of FLO11 through a Tpk2p-dependent mechanism. Mutants defective in synthesis of these alcohols show reduced filamentous growth, which is partially suppressed by the addition of these aromatic alcohols. The production of these auto signaling alcohols is regulated by nitrogen: High ammonia restricts it by repressing the expression of their biosynthetic pathway, whereas nitrogen-poor conditions activate it. Moreover, the production of these aromatic alcohols is controlled by cell density and subjected to positive feedback regulation, which requires the transcription factor Aro80p. These interactions define a quorum-sensing circuit that allows Saccharomyces to respond to both cell density and the nutritional state of the environment. These same autoregulatory molecules do not evoke the morphological switch in Candida albicans, suggesting that these molecular signals are species-specific.},

title = {Functional integration of a metabolic network model and expression data without arbitrary thresholding},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Flux balance analysis (FBA) has been used extensively to analyze genome-scale, constraint-based models of metabolism in a variety of organisms. The predictive accuracy of such models has recently been improved through the integration of high-throughput expression profiles of metabolic genes and proteins. However, extensions of FBA often require that such data be discretized a priori into sets of genes or proteins that are either 'on' or 'off'. This procedure requires selecting relatively subjective expression thresholds, often requiring several iterations and refinements to capture the expression dynamics and retain model functionality.

RESULTS: We present a method for mapping expression data from a set of environmental, genetic or temporal conditions onto a metabolic network model without the need for arbitrary expression thresholds. Metabolic Adjustment by Differential Expression (MADE) uses the statistical significance of changes in gene or protein expression to create a functional metabolic model that most accurately recapitulates the expression dynamics. MADE was used to generate a series of models that reflect the metabolic adjustments seen in the transition from fermentative- to glycerol-based respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The calculated gene states match 98.7% of possible changes in expression, and the resulting models capture functional characteristics of the metabolic shift.

AVAILABILITY: MADE is implemented in Matlab and requires a mixed-integer linear program solver. Source code is freely available at http://www.bme.virginia.edu/csbl/downloads/.},

title = {Extrinsic noise passing through a Michaelis-Menten reaction: a universal response of a genetic switch},
abstract = {The study of biochemical pathways usually focuses on a small section of a protein interactions network. Two distinct sources contribute to the noise in such a system: intrinsic noise, inherent in the studied reactions, and extrinsic noise generated in other parts of the network or in the environment. We study the effect of extrinsic noise entering the system through a nonlinear uptake reaction which acts as a nonlinear filter. Varying input noise intensity varies the mean of the noise after the passage through the filter, which changes the stability properties of the system. The steady-state displacement due to small noise is independent on the kinetics of the system but it only depends on the nonlinearity of the input function. For monotonically increasing and concave input functions such as the Michaelis-Menten uptake rate, we give a simple argument based on the small-noise expansion, which enables qualitative predictions of the steady-state displacement only by inspection of experimental data: when weak and rapid noise enters the system through a Michaelis-Menten reaction, then the graph of the system's steady states vs. the mean of the input signal always shifts to the right as noise intensity increases. We test the predictions on two models of lac operon, where TMG/lactose uptake is driven by a Michaelis-Menten enzymatic process. We show that as a consequence of the steady state displacement due to fluctuations in extracellular TMG/lactose concentration the lac switch responds in an asymmetric manner: as noise intensity increases, switching off lactose metabolism becomes easier and switching it on becomes more difficult.},

title = {Diffusion-driven mechanisms of protein translocation on nucleic acids. 1. Models and theory},
abstract = {Genome regulatory proteins (e.g., repressors or polymerases) that function by binding to specific chromosomal target base pair sequences (e.g., operators or promoters) can appear to arrive at their targets at faster than diffusion-controlled rates. These proteins also exhibit appreciable affinity for nonspecific DNA, and thus this apparently facilitated binding rate must be interpreted in terms of a two-step binding mechanism. The first step involves free diffusion to any nonspecific binding site on the DNA, and the second step comprises a series of protein translocation events that are also driven by thermal fluctuations. Because of nonspecific binding, the search process in the second step is of reduced dimensionality (or volume); this results in an accelerated apparent rate of target location. In this paper we define four types of processes that may be involved in these protein translocation events between DNA sites. These are (i) "macroscopic" dissociation--reassociation processes within the domain of the DNA molecule, (ii) "microscopic" dissociation--reassociation events between closely spaced sites in the DNA molecule, (iii) "intersegment transfer" (via "ring-closure") processes between different segments of the DNA molecule, and (iv) "sliding" along the DNA molecule. We present mathematical and physical descriptions of each of these processes, and the consequences of each for the overall rate of target location are worked out as a function of both the nonspecific binding affinity between protein and DNA and the length of the DNA molecule containing the target sequence. The theory is developed in terms of the Escherichia coli lac repressor--operator interaction since data for testing these approaches are available for this system [Barkley, M. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 3833; Winter, R. B., {\&} von Hippel, P. H. (1981) Biochemistry (second paper of three in this issue); Winter, R. B., Berg, O. G., {\&} von Hippel, P. H. (1981) Biochemistry (third paper of three in this issue)]. However, we emphasize that this approach is general for the analysis of mechanisms of biological target location involving facilitated transfer processes via nonspecific binding to the general system of which the target forms a small part.},

abstract = {We track the motion of individual fluorescently labeled mRNA molecules inside live E. coli cells. We find that the motion is subdiffusive, with an exponent that is robust to physiological changes, including the disruption of cytoskeletal elements. By modifying the parameters of the RNA molecule and the bacterial cell, we are able to examine the possible mechanisms that can lead to this unique type of motion, especially the effect of macromolecular crowding. We also examine the implications of anomalous diffusion on the kinetics of bacterial gene regulation, in particular, how transcription factors find their DNA targets.},

title = {Coarse-grained molecular simulation of diffusion and reaction kinetics in a crowded virtual cytoplasm},
abstract = {We present a general-purpose model for biomolecular simulations at the molecular level that incorporates stochasticity, spatial dependence, and volume exclusion, using diffusing and reacting particles with physical dimensions. To validate the model, we first established the formal relationship between the microscopic model parameters (timestep, move length, and reaction probabilities) and the macroscopic coefficients for diffusion and reaction rate. We then compared simulation results with Smoluchowski theory for diffusion-limited irreversible reactions and the best available approximation for diffusion-influenced reversible reactions. To simulate the volumetric effects of a crowded intracellular environment, we created a virtual cytoplasm composed of a heterogeneous population of particles diffusing at rates appropriate to their size. The particle-size distribution was estimated from the relative abundance, mass, and stoichiometries of protein complexes using an experimentally derived proteome catalog from Escherichia coli K12. Simulated diffusion constants exhibited anomalous behavior as a function of time and crowding. Although significant, the volumetric impact of crowding on diffusion cannot fully account for retarded protein mobility in vivo, suggesting that other biophysical factors are at play. The simulated effect of crowding on barnase-barstar dimerization, an experimentally characterized example of a bimolecular association reaction, reveals a biphasic time course, indicating that crowding exerts different effects over different timescales. These observations illustrate that quantitative realism in biosimulation will depend to some extent on mesoscale phenomena that are not currently well understood.},

title = {Kinetic studies of inducer binding to lac repressor.operator complex},
abstract = {The rates of binding of inducer molecules to the lactose repressor protein are significantly affected by the presence of bound operator DNA fragments. The association rate is decreased from 4.6 x 10(4) M-1S-1 to 1.0 x 10(4) M-1S-1 by the presence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments. The inducer dissociation rate was measured by dilution of repressor . operator . inducer complexes and by displacement of the sugar molecule from repressor by the binding of operator DNA. The value for the dissociation rate in the presence of bound DNA was 0.8 S-1; this is 4-fold greater than the inducer dissociation rate measured in the absence of operator. These kinetic results suggest that repressor should exhibit a 20-fold lower affinity for inducer when operator DNA fragments are bound; this prediction is in agreement with previous equilibrium measurements. Measurement of the rate of operator fragment dissociation from repressor using a nitrocellulose filter assay yields a value of 0.04 S-1 in the absence of inducer; this dissociation rate is too rapid to measure in the presence of bound inducer molecules. Calculations assuming that the DNA-protein association rate is unaffected by sugar binding suggest that the rate of dissociation of DNA from repressor containing 4 bound inducer molecules may be as high as 40 S-1. Determination of the apparent association rate for inducer binding to operator DNA fragments indicates that DNA molecules do dissociate from the protein . operator . inducer complex at intermediate stages during the sugar binding reaction. The exact point at which dissociation occurs at a complex function of the concentrations of operator and inducer and the relationship between the rates for sugar binding and for operator fragment dissociation which are comparable for some of the protein species.},

Recently, a number of studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of stochastic processes in gene expression by utilizing new methods capable of counting individual mRNAs and proteins in cells. In this review, we examine the insights that these studies have yielded in the field of stochastic gene expression. In particular, we discuss how these studies have played in understanding the properties of bursts in gene expression. We also compare the array of different methods that have arisen for single mRNA and protein detection, highlighting their relative strengths and weaknesses. In conclusion, we point out further areas where single-molecule techniques applied to gene expression may lead to new discoveries.},

title = {Integrating metabolic, transcriptional regulatory and signal transduction models in Escherichia coli},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The effort to build a whole-cell model requires the development of new modeling approaches, and in particular, the integration of models for different types of processes, each of which may be best described using different representation. Flux-balance analysis (FBA) has been useful for large-scale analysis of metabolic networks, and methods have been developed to incorporate transcriptional regulation (regulatory FBA, or rFBA). Of current interest is the integration of these approaches with detailed models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

RESULTS: We developed an approach to modeling the dynamic behavior of metabolic, regulatory and signaling networks by combining FBA with regulatory Boolean logic, and ordinary differential equations. We use this approach (called integrated FBA, or iFBA) to create an integrated model of Escherichia coli which combines a flux-balance-based, central carbon metabolic and transcriptional regulatory model with an ODE-based, detailed model of carbohydrate uptake control. We compare the predicted Escherichia coli wild-type and single gene perturbation phenotypes for diauxic growth on glucose/lactose and glucose/glucose-6-phosphate with that of the individual models. We find that iFBA encapsulates the dynamics of three internal metabolites and three transporters inadequately predicted by rFBA. Furthermore, we find that iFBA predicts different and more accurate phenotypes than the ODE model for 85 of 334 single gene perturbation simulations, as well for the wild-type simulations. We conclude that iFBA is a significant improvement over the individual rFBA and ODE modeling paradigms.

abstract = {Riboswitches are structured noncoding RNA domains that selectively bind metabolites and control gene expression (Mandal and Breaker 2004a; Coppins et al. 2007; Roth and Breaker 2009). Nearly all examples of the known riboswitches reside in noncoding regions of messenger RNAs where they control transcription or translation. Newfound classes of riboswitches are being reported at a rate of about three per year (Ames and Breaker 2009), and these have been shown to selectively respond to fundamental metabolites including coenzymes, nucleobases or their derivatives, amino acids, and other small molecule ligands. The characteristics of some riboswitches suggest they could be modern descendents of an ancient sensory and regulatory system that likely functioned before the emergence of enzymes and genetic factors made of protein (Nahvi et al. 2002; Vitreschak et al. 2004; Breaker 2006). If true, then some of the riboswitch structures and functions that serve modern cells so well may accurately reflect the capabilities of RNA sensors and switches that existed in the RNA World. This article will address some of the characteristics of modern riboswitches that may be relevant to ancient versions of these metabolite-sensing RNAs.},

title = {Protein self-organization: lessons from the min system},
abstract = {One of the most fundamental features of biological systems is probably their ability to self-organize in space and time on different scales. Despite many elaborate theoretical models of how molecular self-organization can come about, only a few experimental systems of biological origin have so far been rigorously described, due mostly to their inherent complexity. The most promising strategy of modern biophysics is thus to identify minimal biological systems showing self-organized emergent behavior. One of the best-understood examples of protein self-organization, which has recently been successfully reconstituted in vitro, is represented by the oscillations of the Min proteins in Escherichia coli. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanism of Min protein self-organization in vivo and in vitro. We discuss the potential of the Min oscillations to sense the geometry of the cell and suggest that spontaneous protein waves could be a general means of intracellular organization. We hypothesize that cooperative membrane binding and unbinding, e.g., as an energy-dependent switch, may act as an important regulatory mechanism for protein oscillations and pattern formation in the cell.},

title = {Analytical distributions for stochastic gene expression},
abstract = {Gene expression is significantly stochastic making modeling of genetic networks challenging. We present an approximation that allows the calculation of not only the mean and variance, but also the distribution of protein numbers. We assume that proteins decay substantially more slowly than their mRNA and confirm that many genes satisfy this relation by using high-throughput data from budding yeast. For a two-stage model of gene expression, with transcription and translation as first-order reactions, we calculate the protein distribution for all times greater than several mRNA lifetimes and thus qualitatively predict the distribution of times for protein levels to first cross an arbitrary threshold. If in addition the fluctuates between inactive and active states, we can find the steady-state protein distribution, which can be bimodal if fluctuations of the promoter are slow. We show that our assumptions imply that protein synthesis occurs in geometrically distributed bursts and allows mRNA to be eliminated from a master equation description. In general, we find that protein distributions are asymmetric and may be poorly characterized by their mean and variance. Through maximum likelihood methods, our expressions should therefore allow more quantitative comparisons with experimental data. More generally, we introduce a technique to derive a simpler, effective dynamics for a stochastic system by eliminating a fast variable.},

title = {Energetics of syntrophic cooperation in methanogenic degradation},
abstract = {Fatty acids and alcohols are key intermediates in the methanogenic degradation of organic matter, e.g., in anaerobic sewage sludge digestors or freshwater lake sediments. They are produced by classical fermenting bacteria for disposal of electrons derived in simultaneous substrate oxidations. Methanogenic bacteria can degrade primarily only one-carbon compounds. Therefore, acetate, propionate, ethanol, and their higher homologs have to be fermented further to one-carbon compounds. These fermentations are called secondary or syntrophic fermentations. They are endergonic processes under standard conditions and depend on intimate coupling with methanogenesis. The energetic situation of the prokaryotes cooperating in these processes is problematic: the free energy available in the reactions for total conversion of substrate to methane attributes to each partner amounts of energy in the range of the minimum biochemically convertible energy, i.e., 20 to 25 kJ per mol per reaction. This amount corresponds to one-third of an ATP unit and is equivalent to the energy required for a monovalent ion to cross the charged cytoplasmic membrane. Recent studies have revealed that syntrophically fermenting bacteria synthesize ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation and reinvest part of the ATP-bound energy into reversed electron transport processes, to release the electrons at a redox level accessible by the partner bacteria and to balance their energy budget. These findings allow us to understand the energy economy of these bacteria on the basis of concepts derived from the bioenergetics of other microorganisms.},

title = {Chemical Models of Genetic Toggle Switches},
abstract = {We study by mean-field analysis and stochastic simulations chemical models for genetic toggle switches formed from pairs of genes that mutually repress each other. To determine the stability of the genetic switches, we make a connection with reactive flux theory and transition state theory. The switch stability is characterized by a well-defined lifetime τ. We find that τ grows exponentially with the mean number N̄ of transcription factor molecules involved in the switching. In the regime accessible to direct numerical simulations, the growth law is well-characterized by τ ≈ N̄α exp(bN̄), where α and b are parameters. The switch stability is decreased by phenomena that increase the noise in gene expression, such as the production of multiple copies of a protein from a single mRNA transcript (shot noise) and fluctuations in the number of proteins produced per transcript. However, robustness against biochemical noise can be drastically enhanced by arranging the transcription factor binding domains on the DN...},

title = {Functional characterization of alternate optimal solutions of Escherichia coli's transcriptional and translational machinery},
abstract = {The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis approach has recently been extended to describe Escherichia coli's transcriptional and translational machinery. Here, we introduce the concept of reaction coupling to represent the dependency between protein synthesis and utilization. These coupling constraints lead to a significant contraction of the feasible set of steady-state fluxes. The subset of alternate optimal solutions (AOS) consistent with maximal ribosome production was calculated. The majority of transcriptional and translational reactions were active for all of these AOS, showing that the network has a low degree of redundancy. Furthermore, all calculated AOS contained the qualitative expression of at least 92% of the known essential genes. Principal component analysis of AOS demonstrated that energy currencies (ATP, GTP, and phosphate) dominate the network's capability to produce ribosomes. Additionally, we identified regulatory control points of the network, which include the transcription reactions of sigma70 (RpoD) as well as that of a degradosome component (Rne) and of tRNA charging (ValS). These reactions contribute significant variance among AOS. These results show that constraint-based modeling can be applied to gain insight into the systemic properties of E. coli's transcriptional and translational machinery.},

title = {Binding of coenzyme B induces a major conformational change in the active site of methyl-coenzyme M reductase},
abstract = {Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the key enzyme in methane formation by methanogenic Archaea. It converts the thioether methyl-coenzyme M and the thiol coenzyme B into methane and the heterodisulfide of coenzyme M and coenzyme B. The catalytic mechanism of MCR and the role of its prosthetic group, the nickel hydrocorphin coenzyme F(430), is still disputed, and no intermediates have been observed so far by fast spectroscopic techniques when the enzyme was incubated with the natural substrates. In the presence of the competitive inhibitor coenzyme M instead of methyl-coenzyme M, addition of coenzyme B to the active Ni(I) state MCR(red1) induces two new species called MCR(red2a) and MCR(red2r) which have been characterized by pulse EPR spectroscopy. Here we show that the two MCR(red2) signals can also be induced by the S-methyl- and the S-trifluoromethyl analogs of coenzyme B. (19)F-ENDOR data for MCR(red2a) and MCR(red2r) induced by S-CF(3)-coenzyme B show that, upon binding of the coenzyme B analog, the end of the 7-thioheptanoyl chain of coenzyme B moves closer to the nickel center of F(430) by more than 2 A as compared to its position in both, the Ni(I) MCR(red1) form and the X-ray structure of the inactive Ni(II) MCR(ox1-silent) form. The finding that the protein is able to undergo a conformational change upon binding of the second substrate helps to explain the dramatic change in the coordination environment induced in the transition from MCR(red1) to MCR(red2) forms and opens the possibility that nickel coordination geometries other than square planar, tetragonal pyramidal, or elongated octahedral might occur in intermediates of the catalytic cycle.},

The parameters entering the models have been taken from the literature or adapted to observed time courses or behaviour. Using this model we can follow the time course of the various complex formation processes and of the phosphorylation states of the proteins involved. Furthermore, we can explain the phenotype of more than a dozen well-characterized mutants and also the graded response of yeast cells to varying concentrations of the stimulating pheromone.},

title = {Regulatory activity revealed by dynamic correlations in gene expression noise},
abstract = {Gene regulatory interactions are context dependent, active in some cellular states but not in others. Stochastic fluctuations, or 'noise', in gene expression propagate through active, but not inactive, regulatory links. Thus, correlations in gene expression noise could provide a noninvasive means to probe the activity states of regulatory links. However, global, 'extrinsic', noise sources generate correlations even without direct regulatory links. Here we show that single-cell time-lapse microscopy, by revealing time lags due to regulation, can discriminate between active regulatory connections and extrinsic noise. We demonstrate this principle mathematically, using stochastic modeling, and experimentally, using simple synthetic gene circuits. We then use this approach to analyze dynamic noise correlations in the galactose metabolism genes of Escherichia coli. We find that the CRPGalS-GalE feed-forward loop is inactive in standard conditions but can become active in a GalR mutant. These results show how noise can help analyze the context dependence of regulatory interactions in endogenous gene circuits.},

Although SPT of mRNA has been performed by labeling mRNA with fluorescent dyes or proteins, observation of mRNA for long durations with high temporal resolution has been difficult due to weak fluorescence and rapid photobleaching. Using quantum dots (QDs), we succeeded in observing the movement of individual mRNAs for more than 60 s, with a temporal resolution of 30 ms. Intronless and truncated ftz mRNA, synthesized in vitro and labeled with QDs, was microinjected into the nuclei of Cos7 cells. Almost all mRNAs were in motion, and statistical analyses revealed anomalous diffusion between barriers, with a microscopic diffusion coefficient of 0.12 microm2/s and a macroscopic diffusion coefficient of 0.025 microm2/s. Diffusion of mRNA was observed in interchromatin regions but not in histone2B-GFP-labeled chromatin regions. These results provide direct evidence of channeled mRNA diffusion in interchromatin regions.},

title = {Metadynamics: a method to simulate rare events and reconstruct the free energy in biophysics, chemistry and material science},
abstract = {Metadynamics is a powerful algorithm that can be used both for reconstructing the free energy and for accelerating rare events in systems described by complex Hamiltonians, at the classical or at the quantum level. In the algorithm the normal evolution of the system is biased by a history-dependent potential constructed as a sum of Gaussians centered along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables. The sum of Gaussians is exploited for reconstructing iteratively an estimator of the free energy and forcing the system to escape from local minima. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, with a focus on the practical aspects that need to be addressed when one attempts to apply metadynamics to a new system: (i) the choice of the appropriate set of collective variables; (ii) the optimal choice of the metadynamics parameters and (iii) how to control the error and ensure convergence of the algorithm.},

title = {When does the Michaelis-Menten equation hold for fluctuating enzymes?},
abstract = {Enzymes are dynamic entities: both their conformation and catalytic activity fluctuate over time. When such fluctuations are relatively fast, it is not surprising that the classical Michaelis-Menten (MM) relationship between the steady-state enzymatic velocity and the substrate concentration still holds. However, recent single-molecule experiments have shown that this is the case even for an enzyme whose catalytic activity fluctuates on the 10(-4)-10 s range. The purpose of this paper is to examine various scenarios in which slowly fluctuating enzymes would still obey the MM relationship. Specifically, we consider (1) the quasi-static condition (e.g., the conformational fluctuation of the enzyme-substrate complex is much slower than binding, catalysis, and the conformational fluctuations of the free enzyme), (2) the quasi-equilibrium condition (when the substrate dissociation is much faster than catalysis, irrespective of the time scales or amplitudes of conformational fluctuations), and (3) the conformational-equilibrium condition (when the dissociation and catalytic rates depend on the conformational coordinate in the same way). For each of these scenarios, the physical meaning of the apparent Michaelis constant and catalytic rate constant is provided. Finally, as an example, the theoretical analysis of a recent single-molecule enzyme assay is considered in light of the perspectives presented in this paper.},

title = {Multiple modes of interconverting dynamic pattern formation by bacterial cell division proteins},
abstract = {Min proteins of the Escherichia coli cell division system oscillate between the cell poles in vivo. In vitro on a solid-surface supported lipid bilayer, these proteins exhibit a number of interconverting modes of collective ATP-driven dynamic pattern formation including not only the previously described propagating waves, but also near uniformity in space surface concentration oscillation, propagating filament like structures with a leading head and decaying tail and moving and dividing amoeba-like structures with sharp edges. We demonstrate that the last behavior most closely resembles in vivo system behavior. The simple reaction-diffusion models previously proposed for the Min system fail to explain the results of the in vitro self-organization experiments. We propose the hypotheses that initiation of MinD binding to the surface is controlled by counteraction of initiation and dissociation complexes; the binding of MinD/E is stimulated by MinE and involves polymerization-depolymerization dynamics; polymerization of MinE over MinD oligomers triggers dynamic instability leading to detachment from the membrane. The physical properties of the lipid bilayer are likely to be one of the critical determinants of certain aspects of the dynamic patterns observed.},

title = {Archaeal population dynamics during sequential reduction processes in rice field soil},
abstract = {The population dynamics of Archaea after flooding of an Italian rice field soil were studied over 17 days. Anoxically incubated rice field soil slurries exhibited a typical sequence of reduction processes characterized by reduction of nitrate, Fe(3+), and sulfate prior to the initiation of methane production. Archaeal population dynamics were followed using a dual approach involving molecular sequence retrieval and fingerprinting of small-subunit (SSU) rRNA genes. We retrieved archaeal sequences from four clone libraries (30 each) constructed for different time points (days 0, 1, 8, and 17) after flooding of the soil. The clones could be assigned to known methanogens (i.e., Methanosarcinaceae, Methanosaetaceae, Methanomicrobiaceae, and Methanobacteriaceae) and to novel euryarchaeotal (rice clusters I, II, and III) and crenarchaeotal (rice clusters IV and VI) lineages previously detected in anoxic rice field soil and on rice roots (R. Grosskopf, S. Stubner, and W. Liesack, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 64:4983-4989, 1998). During the initiation of methanogenesis (days 0 to 17), we detected significant changes in the frequency of individual clones, especially of those affiliated with the Methanosaetaceae and Methanobacteriaceae. However, these findings could not be confirmed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of SSU rDNA amplicons. Most likely, the fluctuations in sequence composition of clone libraries resulted from cloning bias. Clonal SSU rRNA gene sequences were used to define operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for T-RFLP analysis, which were distinguished by group-specific TaqI restriction sites. Sequence analysis showed a high degree of conservation of TaqI restriction sites within the different archaeal lineages present in Italian rice field soil. Direct T-RFLP analysis of archaeal populations in rice field soil slurries revealed the presence of all archaeal lineages detected by cloning with a predominance of terminal restriction fragments characteristic of rice cluster I (389 bp), Methanosaetaceae (280 bp), and Methanosarcinaceae/rice cluster VI (182 bp). In general, the relative gene frequency of most detected OTUs remained rather constant over time during the first 17 days after flooding of the soil. Most minor OTUs (e.g., Methanomicrobiaceae and rice cluster III) and Methanosaetaceae did not change in relative frequency. Rice cluster I (37 to 30%) and to a lesser extent rice cluster IV as well as Methanobacteriaceae decreased over time. Only the relative abundance of Methanosarcinaceae (182 bp) increased, roughly doubling from 15 to 29% of total archaeal gene frequency within the first 11 days, which was positively correlated to the dynamics of acetate and formate concentrations. Our results indicate that a functionally dynamic ecosystem, a rice field soil after flooding, was linked to a relatively stable archaeal community structure.},

About a third of the heteromultimeric complexes show higher levels of proteome organization, including assembly into larger, multiprotein complex entities, suggesting sequential steps in biological processes, and extensive sharing of components, implying protein multifunctionality. Incorporation of structural models for 484 proteins, single-particle electron microscopy, and cellular electron tomograms provided supporting structural details for this proteome organization.

title = {The functional integration of a polytopic membrane protein of Escherichia coli is dependent on the bacterial signal-recognition particle},
abstract = {In eukaryotes, the cotranslational targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticular membrane is initially mediated by the signal-recognition particle (SRP), a ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of the 7SL RNA and six protein subunits. Since the discovery of sequence homology between (a) the Escherichia coli 4.5S RNA (Ffs) and 7SL RNA, and (b) the E. coli P48 (Ffh) and SRP 54-kDa subunit, more evidence has been obtained that E. coli also possesses an SRP-type pathway that acts in the translocation of secreted proteins. Such a pathway could possibly be involved in the cotranslational integration of hydrophobic membrane proteins that cannot be effectively targeted post-translationally due to folding and aggregation. In this study, we report that disruption of the E. coli SRP complex with a dominant lethal 4.5S RNA mutant in vivo prevents functional membrane integration of the E. coli lactose permease (LacY). Likewise, depletion of the P48 (Ffh) protein also results in a decrease in the amount of functional LacY inserted into the E. coli plasma membrane. In direct contrast, inhibition of SecA function does not affect LacY integration. These results suggest a major function of the bacterial SRP in the targeting and subsequent integration of hydrophobic membrane proteins as opposed to SecA mediating the post-translational targeting of secretory proteins.},

abstract = {Morphogen gradients play a key role in multiple differentiation processes. Both the formation of the gradient and its interpretation by the receiving cells need to occur at high precision to ensure reproducible patterning. This need for quantitative precision is challenged by fluctuations in the environmental conditions and by variations in the genetic makeup of the developing embryos. We discuss mechanisms that buffer morphogen profiles against variations in gene dosage. Self-enhanced morphogen degradation and pre-steady-state decoding provide general means for buffering the morphogen profile against fluctuations in morphogen production rate. A more specific "shuttling" mechanism, which establishes a sharp and robust activation profile of a widely expressed morphogen, and enables the adjustment of morphogen profile with embryo size, is also described. Finally, we consider the transformation of the smooth gradient profile into sharp borders of gene expression in the signal-receiving cells. The integration theory and experiments are increasingly used, providing key insights into the system-level functioning of the developmental system.},

title = {Reaction rate theory: what it was, where is it today, and where is it going?},
abstract = {A brief history is presented, outlining the development of rate theory during the past century. Starting from Arrhenius [Z. Phys. Chem. 4, 226 (1889)], we follow especially the formulation of transition state theory by Wigner [Z. Phys. Chem. Abt. B 19, 203 (1932)] and Eyring [J. Chem. Phys. 3, 107 (1935)]. Transition state theory (TST) made it possible to obtain quick estimates for reaction rates for a broad variety of processes even during the days when sophisticated computers were not available. Arrhenius' suggestion that a transition state exists which is intermediate between reactants and products was central to the development of rate theory. Although Wigner gave an abstract definition of the transition state as a surface of minimal unidirectional flux, it took almost half of a century until the transition state was precisely defined by Pechukas [Dynamics of Molecular Collisions B, edited by W. H. Miller (Plenum, New York, 1976)], but even this only in the realm of classical mechanics. Eyring, considered by many to be the father of TST, never resolved the question as to the definition of the activation energy for which Arrhenius became famous. In 1978, Chandler [J. Chem. Phys. 68, 2959 (1978)] finally showed that especially when considering condensed phases, the activation energy is a free energy, it is the barrier height in the potential of mean force felt by the reacting system. Parallel to the development of rate theory in the chemistry community, Kramers published in 1940 [Physica (Amsterdam) 7, 284 (1940)] a seminal paper on the relation between Einstein's theory of Brownian motion [Einstein, Ann. Phys. 17, 549 (1905)] and rate theory. Kramers' paper provided a solution for the effect of friction on reaction rates but left us also with some challenges. He could not derive a uniform expression for the rate, valid for all values of the friction coefficient, known as the Kramers turnover problem. He also did not establish the connection between his approach and the TST developed by the chemistry community. For many years, Kramers' theory was considered as providing a dynamic correction to the thermodynamic TST. Both of these questions were resolved in the 1980s when Pollak [J. Chem. Phys. 85, 865 (1986)] showed that Kramers' expression in the moderate to strong friction regime could be derived from TST, provided that the bath, which is the source of the friction, is handled at the same level as the system which is observed. This then led to the Mel'nikov-Pollak-Grabert-Hanggi [Mel'nikov and Meshkov, J. Chem. Phys. 85, 1018 (1986); Pollak, Grabert, and Hanggi, ibid. 91, 4073 (1989)] solution of the turnover problem posed by Kramers. Although classical rate theory reached a high level of maturity, its quantum analog leaves the theorist with serious challenges to this very day. As noted by Wigner [Trans. Faraday Soc. 34, 29 (1938)], TST is an inherently classical theory. A definite quantum TST has not been formulated to date although some very useful approximate quantum rate theories have been invented. The successes and challenges facing quantum rate theory are outlined. An open problem which is being investigated intensively is rate theory away from equilibrium. TST is no longer valid and cannot even serve as a conceptual guide for understanding the critical factors which determine rates away from equilibrium. The nonequilibrium quantum theory is even less well developed than the classical, and suffers from the fact that even today, we do not know how to solve the real time quantum dynamics for systems with "many" degrees of freedom.},

title = {Compartmentalization of transcription and translation in Bacillus subtilis},
abstract = {Using fusions of green fluorescent protein to subunits of RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosomes, we have investigated the subcellular localization of the transcriptional and translational machinery in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Unexpectedly, we found that RNAP resides principally within the nucleoid. Conversely, ribosomes localized almost exclusively outside the nucleoid, concentrating particularly towards sites of cell division. This zonal localization was not dependent on cell division and is probably due, at least in part, to exclusion from the nucleoid. Dual labelling of RNAP and ribosomes was used to confirm the spatial separation of the two processes. We conclude that, even in the absence of a nuclear membrane, transcription and translation occur predominantly in separate functional domains. At higher growth rates, concentrations of RNAP developed, probably representing the sites of rRNA synthesis. These may represent a further spatial specialization, possibly equivalent to the eukaryotic nucleolus.},

title = {Nonequilibrium umbrella sampling in spaces of many order parameters},
abstract = {We recently introduced an umbrella sampling method for obtaining nonequilibrium steady-state probability distributions projected onto an arbitrary number of coordinates that characterize a system (order parameters) [A. Warmflash, P. Bhimalapuram, and A. R. Dinner, J. Chem. Phys. 127, 154112 (2007)]. Here, we show how our algorithm can be combined with the image update procedure from the finite-temperature string method for reversible processes [E. Vanden-Eijnden and M. Venturoli, "Revisiting the finite temperature string method for calculation of reaction tubes and free energies," J. Chem. Phys. (in press)] to enable restricted sampling of a nonequilibrium steady state in the vicinity of a path in a many-dimensional space of order parameters. For the study of transitions between stable states, the adapted algorithm results in improved scaling with the number of order parameters and the ability to progressively refine the regions of enforced sampling. We demonstrate the algorithm by applying it to a two-dimensional model of driven Brownian motion and a coarse-grained (Ising) model for nucleation under shear. It is found that the choice of order parameters can significantly affect the convergence of the simulation; local magnetization variables other than those used previously for sampling transition paths in Ising systems are needed to ensure that the reactive flux is primarily contained within a tube in the space of order parameters. The relation of this method to other algorithms that sample the statistics of path ensembles is discussed.},

The analysis adopts a discrete-stochastic point of view and focuses on the model reaction set S(1)<=>S(2)-->S(3), whose simplicity allows all the mathematics to be done exactly. The advantages and disadvantages of replacing this reaction set with a single S(3)-producing reaction are analyzed quantitatively using novel criteria for measuring simulation accuracy and simulation efficiency. It is shown that in all cases in which such a model reduction can be accomplished accurately and with a significant gain in simulation efficiency, a procedure called the slow-scale stochastic simulation algorithm provides a robust and theoretically transparent way of implementing the reduction.},

Understanding how cells respond to specific challenges, how these responses are contravened in diseased cells, and how to intervene pharmacologically in the decision-making processes of cells requires an accurate theory of the information-processing capabilities of macromolecular regulatory networks.

We show that such functional motifs exist and review the experimental evidence that they control cellular responses as expected.},

abstract = {The influence of the high intracellular concentration of macromolecules on cell physiology is increasingly appreciated, but its impact on system-level cellular functions remains poorly quantified. To assess its potential effect, here we develop a flux balance model of Escherichia coli cell metabolism that takes into account a systems-level constraint for the concentration of enzymes catalyzing the various metabolic reactions in the crowded cytoplasm. We demonstrate that the model's predictions for the relative maximum growth rate of wild-type and mutant E. coli cells in single substrate-limited media, and the sequence and mode of substrate uptake and utilization from a complex medium are in good agreement with subsequent experimental observations. These results suggest that molecular crowding represents a bound on the achievable functional states of a metabolic network, and they indicate that models incorporating this constraint can systematically identify alterations in cellular metabolism activated in response to environmental change.},

With the use of structural genomics and systems biology, we generated a three-dimensional reconstruction of the central metabolic network of the bacterium Thermotoga maritima. The network encompassed 478 proteins, of which 120 were determined by experiment and 358 were modeled. Structural analysis revealed that proteins forming the network are dominated by a small number (only 182) of basic shapes (folds) performing diverse but mostly related functions. Most of these folds are already present in the essential core (approximately 30%) of the network, and its expansion by nonessential proteins is achieved with relatively few additional folds. Thus, integration of structural data with networks analysis generates insight into the function, mechanism, and evolution of biological networks.},

Much of what we know about the cell concerns its constituent parts, but to a great extent we have yet to decode how these parts are organized to yield complex physiological function. Classically, we have learned about the organization of cellular networks by disrupting them through genetic or chemical means. The emerging discipline of synthetic biology offers an additional, powerful approach to study systems. By rearranging the parts that comprise existing networks, we can gain valuable insight into the hierarchical logic of the networks and identify the modular building blocks that evolution uses to generate innovative function. In addition, by building minimal toy networks, one can systematically explore the relationship between network structure and function. Here, we outline recent work that uses synthetic biology approaches to investigate the organization and function of cellular networks, and describe a vision for a synthetic biology toolkit that could be used to interrogate the design principles of diverse systems.},

abstract = {Optimal response to environmental stimuli often requires activation of certain genes and repression of others. Dual function regulatory proteins play a key role in the differential regulation of gene expression. While repression can be achieved by any DNA binding protein through steric occlusion of RNA polymerase in the promoter region, activation often requires a surface on the regulatory protein to contact RNAP and thus facilitate transcription initiation. RNAP itself is also a DNA binding protein, therefore it can function as a transcriptional repressor. Searching the Escherichia coli promoter database we found that ∼14% of the identified 'forward' promoters overlap with a promoter oriented in the opposite direction. In this article we combine a mathematical model with experimental analysis of synthetic regulatory regions to investigate interference of overlapping promoters. We find that promoter interference depends on the characteristics of overlapping promoters. The model predicts that promoter strength and interference can be regulated separately, which provides unique opportunities for regulation. Our experimental data suggest that in principle any DNA binding protein can be used for both activation and repression of promoter transcription, depending on the context. These findings can be exploited in the construction of synthetic networks.},

title = {Transcript counting in single cells reveals dynamics of rDNA transcription},
abstract = {Most eukaryotes contain many tandem repeats of ribosomal RNA genes of which only a subset is transcribed at any given time. Current biochemical methods allow for the determination of the fraction of transcribing repeats (ON) versus non-transcribing repeats (OFF) but do not provide any dynamical information and obscure any transcription activity at the single-cell level. Here, we use a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique that allows the detection of single-RNA molecules in individual yeast cells. We use this method complemented with theoretical modeling to determine the rate of switching from OFF to ON (activation rate) and the average number of RNA molecules produced during each transcriptional burst (burst size). We explore how these two variables change in mutants and different growth conditions, and show that this method resolves changes in these two variables even when the average rDNA expression is unaltered. These phenotypic changes could not have been detected by traditional biochemical assays.},

title = {General properties of transcriptional time series in Escherichia coli},
abstract = {Gene activity is described by the time series of discrete, stochastic mRNA production events. This transcriptional time series shows intermittent, bursty behavior. One consequence of this temporal intricacy is that gene expression can be tuned by varying different features of the time series. Here we quantify copy-number statistics of mRNA from 20 Escherichia coli promoters using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization in order to characterize the general properties of these transcriptional time series. We find that the degree of burstiness is correlated with gene expression level but is largely independent of other parameters of gene regulation. The observed behavior can be explained by the underlying variation in the duration of bursting events. Using Shannon's mutual information function, we estimate the mutual information transmitted between an outside stimulus, such as the extracellular concentration of inducer molecules, and intracellular levels of mRNA. This suggests that the outside stimulus transmits information reflected in the properties of transcriptional time series.},

title = {Requirement for formin-induced actin polymerization during spread of Shigella flexneri},
abstract = {Actin polymerization in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane is locally regulated by actin nucleators. Several microbial pathogens exploit cellular actin polymerization to spread through tissue. The movement of the enteric pathogen Shigella flexneri, both within the cell body and from cell to cell, depends on actin polymerization. During intercellular spread, actin polymerization at the bacterial surface generates protrusions of the plasma membrane, which are engulfed by adjacent cells. In the cell body, polymerization of actin by Shigella spp. is dependent on N-WASP activation of the Arp2/Arp3 complex. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast, efficient protrusion formation and intercellular spread depend on actin polymerization that involves activation of the Diaphanous formin Dia. While the Shigella virulence protein IpgB2 can bind and activate Dia1 (N. M. Alto et al., Cell 124:133-145, 2006), its absence does not result in a detectable defect in Dia-dependent protrusion formation or spread. The dependence on the activation of Dia during S. flexneri infection contrasts with the inhibition of this pathway observed during vaccinia virus infection.},

Previous studies on the Escherichia coli 30S subunit suggest that ribosome assembly occurs via multiple parallel pathways rather than through a single rate-limiting step, but little mechanistic information is known about this process. Discovery single-particle profiling (DSP), an application of time-resolved electron microscopy, was used to obtain more than 1 million snapshots of assembling 30S subunits, identify and visualize the structures of 14 assembly intermediates, and monitor the population flux of these intermediates over time. DSP results were integrated with mass spectrometry data to construct the first ribosome-assembly mechanism that incorporates binding dependencies, rate constants, and structural characterization of populated intermediates.},

The assembly and positioning of this cytoskeletal element has to be coordinated with DNA segregation and cell growth to ensure that equal-sized progeny cells are produced, each with a copy of the chromosome. In most prokaryotes, cytokinesis involves positioning a Z ring assembled from FtsZ, the ancestral homologue of tubulin. The position of the Z ring is determined by a gradient of negative regulators of Z-ring assembly. In Escherichia coli, the Min system consists of three proteins that cooperate to position the Z ring through a fascinating oscillation, which inhibits the formation of the Z ring away from midcell. Additional gradients of negative regulators of FtsZ assembly are used by E. coli and other bacteria to achieve spatial control of Z-ring assembly.},

title = {First passage time distribution in stochastic processes with moving and static absorbing boundaries with application to biological rupture experiments},
abstract = {We develop and investigate an integral equation connecting the first passage time distribution of a stochastic process in the presence of an absorbing boundary condition and the corresponding Green's function in the absence of the absorbing boundary. Analytical solutions to the integral equations are obtained for three diffusion processes in time-independent potentials which have been previously investigated by other methods. The integral equation provides an alternative way to analytically solve the three diffusion-controlled reactive processes. In order to help analyze biological rupture experiments, we further investigate the numerical solutions of the integral equation for a diffusion process in a time-dependent potential. Our numerical procedure, based on the exact integral equation, avoids the adiabatic approximation used in previous analytical theories and is useful for fitting the rupture force distribution data from single-molecule pulling experiments or molecular dynamics simulation data, especially at larger pulling speeds, larger cantilever spring constants, and smaller reaction rates. Stochastic simulation results confirm the validity of our numerical procedure. We suggest combining a previous analytical theory with our integral equation approach to analyze the kinetics of force induced rupture of biomacromolecules.},

title = {The X-ray crystal structure of RNA polymerase from Archaea},
abstract = {The transcription apparatus in Archaea can be described as a simplified version of its eukaryotic RNA polymerase (RNAP) II counterpart, comprising an RNAPII-like enzyme as well as two general transcription factors, the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and the eukaryotic TFIIB orthologue TFB. It has been widely understood that precise comparisons of cellular RNAP crystal structures could reveal structural elements common to all enzymes and that these insights would be useful in analysing components of each enzyme that enable it to perform domain-specific gene expression. However, the structure of archaeal RNAP has been limited to individual subunits. Here we report the first crystal structure of the archaeal RNAP from Sulfolobus solfataricus at 3.4 A resolution, completing the suite of multi-subunit RNAP structures from all three domains of life. We also report the high-resolution (at 1.76 A) crystal structure of the D/L subcomplex of archaeal RNAP and provide the first experimental evidence of any RNAP possessing an iron-sulphur (Fe-S) cluster, which may play a structural role in a key subunit of RNAP assembly. The striking structural similarity between archaeal RNAP and eukaryotic RNAPII highlights the simpler archaeal RNAP as an ideal model system for dissecting the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription.},

title = {Methanogenesis by Methanosarcina acetivorans involves two structurally and functionally distinct classes of heterodisulfide reductase},
abstract = {Biochemical studies have revealed two distinct classes of Coenzyme B-Coenzyme M heterodisulfide (CoB-S-S-CoM) reductase (Hdr), a key enzyme required for anaerobic respiration in methane-producing archaea. A cytoplasmic HdrABC enzyme complex is found in most methanogens, whereas a membrane-bound HdrED complex is found exclusively in members of the order Methanosarcinales. Unexpectedly, genomic data indicate that multiple copies of both Hdr classes are found in all sequenced Methanosarcinales genomes. The Methanosarcina acetivorans hdrED1 operon is constitutively expressed and required for viability under all growth conditions examined, consistent with HdrED being the primary Hdr. HdrABC appears to be specifically involved in methylotrophic methanogenesis, based on reduced growth and methanogenesis rates of an hdrA1C1B1 mutant on methylotrophic substrates and downregulation of the genes during growth on acetate. This conclusion is further supported by phylogenetic analysis showing that the presence of hdrA1 in an organism is specifically correlated with the presence of genes for methylotrophic methanogenesis. Examination of mRNA abundance in methanol-grown Delta hdrA1C1B1 strains relative to wild-type revealed upregulation of genes required for synthesis of (di)methylsulfide and for transport and biosynthesis of CoB-SH and CoM-SH, suggesting that the mutant has a defect in electron transfer from ferredoxin to CoB-S-S-CoM that causes cofactor limitation.},

Treating both the protein number and gene expression state variables stochastically and on equal footing, we propose a mapping that connects the molecular level description of networks to the binary representation. We construct a phase diagram indicating when genes can be considered to be independent and when the coupling between them cannot be neglected, which can lead to synchrony or correlations. We find that an appropriately mapped Boolean description reproduces the probabilities of gene expression states of the full stochastic system very well, and can be transferred to examples of self-regulatory systems with a larger number of gene copies.},

abstract = {Different proteins have different expression levels. It is unclear to what extent these expression levels are optimized to their environment. Evolutionary theories suggest that protein expression levels maximize fitness, but the fitness as a function of protein level has seldom been directly measured. To address this, we studied the lac system of Escherichia coli, which allows the cell to use the sugar lactose for growth. We experimentally measured the growth burden due to production and maintenance of the Lac proteins (cost), as well as the growth advantage (benefit) conferred by the Lac proteins when lactose is present. The fitness function, given by the difference between the benefit and the cost, predicts that for each lactose environment there exists an optimal Lac expression level that maximizes growth rate. We then performed serial dilution evolution experiments at different lactose concentrations. In a few hundred generations, cells evolved to reach the predicted optimal expression levels. Thus, protein expression from the lac operon seems to be a solution of a cost-benefit optimization problem, and can be rapidly tuned by evolution to function optimally in new environments.},

title = {Intrinsic noise in gene regulatory networks},
abstract = {Cells are intrinsically noisy biochemical reactors: low reactant numbers can lead to significant statistical fluctuations in molecule numbers and reaction rates. Here we use an analytic model to investigate the emergent noise properties of genetic systems. We find for a single gene that noise is essentially determined at the translational level, and that the mean and variance of protein concentration can be independently controlled. The noise strength immediately following single gene induction is almost twice the final steady-state value. We find that fluctuations in the concentrations of a regulatory protein can propagate through a genetic cascade; translational noise control could explain the inefficient translation rates observed for genes encoding such regulatory proteins. For an autoregulatory protein, we demonstrate that negative feedback efficiently decreases system noise. The model can be used to predict the noise characteristics of networks of arbitrary connectivity. The general procedure is further illustrated for an autocatalytic protein and a bistable genetic switch. The analysis of intrinsic noise reveals biological roles of gene network structures and can lead to a deeper understanding of their evolutionary origin.},

title = {The three operators of the lac operon cooperate in repression},
abstract = {We tested the effect of systematic destruction of all three lac operators of the chromosomal lac operon of Escherichia coli on repression by Lac repressor. Absence of just one 'pseudo-operator' O2 or O3 decreases repression by wild-type tetrameric Lac repressor approximately 2- to 3-fold; absence of both 'pseudo-operators' decreases repression greater than 50-fold. O1 alone represses under these conditions only approximately 20-fold. Dimeric active Lac repressor (iadi) represses the wild-type lac operon to about the same low extent. This indicates that cooperative interaction between lac operators is due to DNA loop formation mediated by tetrameric Lac repressor. Under conditions where loop formation is impossible, occupation of O3 but not of O2 may lead to weak repression. This suggests that under these conditions CAP activation may be inhibited and that stopping transcription at O2 does not significantly contribute to repression.},

title = {Binding of synthetic lactose operator DNAs to lactose represessors},
abstract = {The nitrocellulose filter assay was used to study the interactions of wild-type (SQ) and tight-binding (QX86) lac repressors with synthetic lac operators 21 and 26 base pairs long. The repressor binding properties of both operators were very similar, indicating that both contain the same specific repressor recognition sites. The repressor-operator association rate constants (k(a)) were more sensitive than dissociation rate constants (k(d)) to changes in ionic strength. The responses of both k(a) and k(d) to ionic strength were relatively small compared to the effects previously observed with lambdah80dlac as operator DNA. These results suggest that under natural conditions there are electrostatic interactions between lac repressor and DNA regions outside of the 26 base pair operator sequence. Association rate constants for SQ repressor with either operator are higher than have been predicted for diffusion-limited reactions. We postulate that long-range electrostatic attractions between repressor and operator accelerate the association reaction. The presence of nonoperator DNA decreased association rate constants, the effect being more noticeable at an ionic strength of 0.05 M than at 0.20 M. Nonoperator DNA reduced k(a) values for associations involving QX86 repressor to a greater extent than for those with SQ repressor. The two types of repressors also had different rate constants for interactions with synthetic operators. The values for k(a) and k(d) were both higher with SQ repressor than with QX86 repressor. However, the rate constants were more sensitive to ionic strength when the repressor used was QX86.},

title = {Dynamic localization cycle of the cell division regulator MinE in Escherichia coli},
abstract = {The MinC protein directs placement of the division septum to the middle of Escherichia coli cells by blocking assembly of the division apparatus at other sites. MinD and MinE regulate MinC activity by modulating its cellular location in a unique fashion. MinD recruits MinC to the membrane, and MinE induces MinC/MinD to oscillate rapidly between the membrane of opposite cell halves. Using fixed cells, we previously found that a MinE-green fluorescent protein fusion accumulated in an annular structure at or near the midcell, as well as along the membrane on only one side of the ring. Here we show that in living cells, MinE undergoes a rapid localization cycle that appears coupled to MinD oscillation. The results show that MinE is not a fixed marker for septal ring assembly. Rather, they support a model in which MinE stimulates the removal of MinD from the membrane in a wave-like fashion. These waves run from a midcell position towards the poles in an alternating sequence such that the time-averaged concentration of division inhibitor is lowest at midcell.},

abstract = {The ability of living cells to maintain an inheritable memory of their gene-expression state is key to cellular differentiation. Bacterial lysogeny serves as a simple paradigm for long-term cellular memory. In this study, we address the following question: in the absence of external perturbation, how long will a cell stay in the lysogenic state before spontaneously switching away from that state? We show by direct measurement that lysogen stability exhibits a simple exponential dependence on the frequency of activity bursts from the fate-determining gene, cI. We quantify these gene-activity bursts using single-molecule-resolution mRNA measurements in individual cells, analyzed using a stochastic mathematical model of the gene-network kinetics. The quantitative relation between stability and gene activity is independent of the fine details of gene regulation, suggesting that a quantitative prediction of cell-state stability may also be possible in more complex systems.},

title = {Structural insight into methyl-coenzyme M reductase chemistry using coenzyme B analogues},
abstract = {Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step in methane biogenesis: the reduction of methyl-coenzyme M (methyl-SCoM) by coenzyme B (CoBSH) to methane and a heterodisulfide (CoBS-SCoM). Crystallographic studies show that the active site is deeply buried within the enzyme and contains a highly reduced nickel-tetrapyrrole, coenzyme F(430). Methyl-SCoM must enter the active site prior to CoBSH, as species derived from methyl-SCoM are always observed bound to the F(430) nickel in the deepest part of the 30 A long substrate channel that leads from the protein surface to the active site. The seven-carbon mercaptoalkanoyl chain of CoBSH binds within a 16 A predominantly hydrophobic part of the channel close to F(430), with the CoBSH thiolate lying closest to the nickel at a distance of 8.8 A. It has previously been suggested that binding of CoBSH initiates catalysis by inducing a conformational change that moves methyl-SCoM closer to the nickel promoting cleavage of the C-S bond of methyl-SCoM. In order to better understand the structural role of CoBSH early in the MCR mechanism, we have determined crystal structures of MCR in complex with four different CoBSH analogues: pentanoyl, hexanoyl, octanoyl, and nonanoyl derivatives of CoBSH (CoB(5)SH, CoB(6)SH, CoB(8)SH, and CoB(9)SH, respectively). The data presented here reveal that the shorter CoB(5)SH mercaptoalkanoyl chain overlays with that of CoBSH but terminates two units short of the CoBSH thiolate position. In contrast, the mercaptoalkanoyl chain of CoB(6)SH adopts a different conformation, such that its thiolate is coincident with the position of the CoBSH thiolate. This is consistent with the observation that CoB(6)SH is a slow substrate. A labile water in the substrate channel was found to be a sensitive indicator for the presence of CoBSH and HSCoM. The longer CoB(8)SH and CoB(9)SH analogues can be accommodated in the active site through exclusion of this water. These analogues react with Ni(III)-methyl, a proposed MCR catalytic intermediate of methanogenesis. The CoB(8)SH thiolate is 2.6 A closer to the nickel than that of CoBSH, but the additional carbon of CoB(9)SH only decreases the nickel thiolate distance a further 0.3 A. Although the analogues do not induce any structural changes in the substrate channel, the thiolates appear to preferentially bind at two distinct positions in the channel, one being the previously observed CoBSH thiolate position and the other being at a hydrophobic annulus of residues that lines the channel proximal to the nickel.},

abstract = {Bacterial chromosomes are confined in submicrometer-sized nucleoids. Chromosome organization is facilitated by nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs), but the mechanisms of action remain elusive. In this work, we used super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, in combination with a chromosome-conformation capture assay, to study the distributions of major NAPs in live Escherichia coli cells. Four NAPs--HU, Fis, IHF, and StpA--were largely scattered throughout the nucleoid. In contrast, H-NS, a global transcriptional silencer, formed two compact clusters per chromosome, driven by oligomerization of DNA-bound H-NS through interactions mediated by the amino-terminal domain of the protein. H-NS sequestered the regulated operons into these clusters and juxtaposed numerous DNA segments broadly distributed throughout the chromosome. Deleting H-NS led to substantial chromosome reorganization. These observations demonstrate that H-NS plays a key role in global chromosome organization in bacteria.},

Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

abstract = {The biological community is now awash in high-throughput data sets and is grappling with the challenge of integrating disparate data sets. Such integration has taken the form of statistical analysis of large data sets, or through the bottom-up reconstruction of reaction networks. While progress has been made with statistical and structural methods, large-scale systems have remained refractory to dynamic model building by traditional approaches. The availability of annotated genomes enabled the reconstruction of genome-scale networks, and now the availability of high-throughput metabolomic and fluxomic data along with thermodynamic information opens the possibility to build genome-scale kinetic models. We describe here a framework for building and analyzing such models. The mathematical analysis challenges are reflected in four foundational properties, (i) the decomposition of the Jacobian matrix into chemical, kinetic and thermodynamic information, (ii) the structural similarity between the stoichiometric matrix and the transpose of the gradient matrix, (iii) the duality transformations enabling either fluxes or concentrations to serve as the independent variables and (iv) the timescale hierarchy in biological networks. Recognition and appreciation of these properties highlight notable and challenging new in silico analysis issues.},

Transmitting information through complex signaling networks with redundancies can overcome this limitation. We developed an integrative theoretical and experimental framework, based on the formalism of information theory, to quantitatively predict and measure the amount of information transduced by molecular and cellular networks. Analyzing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling revealed that individual TNF signaling pathways transduce information sufficient for accurate binary decisions, and an upstream bottleneck limits the information gained via multiple pathways together. Negative feedback to this bottleneck could both alleviate and enhance its limiting effect, despite decreasing noise. Bottlenecks likewise constrain information attained by networks signaling through multiple genes or cells.},

We have developed in vivo protein occupancy display (IPOD), a technology that reveals protein occupancy across an entire bacterial chromosome at the resolution of individual binding sites. Application to Escherichia coli reveals thousands of protein occupancy peaks, highly enriched within and in close proximity to noncoding regulatory regions. In addition, we discovered extensive (>1 kilobase) protein occupancy domains (EPODs), some of which are localized to highly expressed genes, enriched in RNA-polymerase occupancy. However, the majority are localized to transcriptionally silent loci dominated by conserved hypothetical ORFs. These regions are highly enriched in both predicted and experimentally determined binding sites of nucleoid proteins and exhibit extreme biophysical characteristics such as high intrinsic curvature. Our observations implicate these transcriptionally silent EPODs as the elusive organizing centers, long proposed to topologically isolate chromosomal domains.},

abstract = {Cellular messenger RNA levels are achieved by the combinatorial complexity of factors controlling transcription, yet the small number of molecules involved in these pathways fluctuates stochastically. It has not yet been experimentally possible to observe the activity of single polymerases on an endogenous gene to elucidate how these events occur in vivo. Here, we describe a method of fluctuation analysis of fluorescently labeled RNA to measure dynamics of nascent RNA-including initiation, elongation, and termination-at an active yeast locus. We find no transcriptional memory between initiation events, and elongation speed can vary by threefold throughout the cell cycle. By measuring the abundance and intranuclear mobility of an upstream transcription factor, we observe that the gene firing rate is directly determined by trans-activating factor search times.},

title = {Replica exchange simulations of transient encounter complexes in protein-protein association},
abstract = {Recent paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) studies on several weakly interacting protein complexes have unequivocally demonstrated the existence of transient encounter complexes. Here, we present a computational method to study protein-protein binding by creating equilibrium ensembles that include both specific and nonspecific protein complexes. In a joint analysis of simulation and experiment we explore the physical nature and underlying physicochemical characteristics of encounter complexes involving three protein-protein interactions of the bacterial phosphotransferase system. Replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations using a coarse-grained energy function recover the structures of the specific complexes and produce binding affinities in good agreement with experiment. Together with the specific complex, a relatively small number of distinct nonspecific complexes largely accounts for the measured PRE data. The combined relative population of the latter is less than approximately 10%. The binding interfaces of the specific and nonspecific complexes differ primarily in size but exhibit similar amino acid compositions. We find that the overall funnel-shaped energy landscape of complex formation is dominated by the specific complex, a small number of structured nonspecific complexes, and a diffuse cloud of loosely bound complexes connecting the specific and nonspecific binding sites with each other and the unbound state. Nonspecific complexes may not only accelerate the binding kinetics by enhancing the rate of success of random diffusional encounters but also play a role in protein function as alternative binding modes.},

Noise, far from just a nuisance, has begun to be appreciated for its essential role in key cellular activities. Noise functions in both microbial and eukaryotic cells, in multicellular development, and in evolution. It enables coordination of gene expression across large regulons, as well as probabilistic differentiation strategies that function across cell populations. At the longest timescales, noise may facilitate evolutionary transitions. Here we review examples and emerging principles that connect noise, the architecture of the gene circuits in which it is present, and the biological functions it enables. We further indicate some of the important challenges and opportunities going forward.},

abstract = {Cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and adaptation to environmental changes are regulated by protein phosphorylation. Development of sensitive and comprehensive analytical methods for determination of protein phosphorylation is therefore a necessity in the pursuit of a detailed molecular view of complex biological processes. We present a quantitative modification-specific proteomic approach that combines stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for quantitation with IMAC for phosphopeptide enrichment and three stages of mass spectrometry (MS/MS/MS) for identification. This integrated phosphoproteomic technology identified and quantified phosphorylation in key regulator and effector proteins of a prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, the yeast pheromone response. SILAC encoding of yeast proteomes was achieved by incorporation of [(13)C(6)]arginine and [(13)C(6)]lysine in a double auxotroph yeast strain. Pheromone-treated yeast cells were mixed with SILAC-encoded cells as the control and lysed, and extracted proteins were digested with trypsin. Phosphopeptides were enriched by a combination of strong cation exchange chromatography and IMAC. Phosphopeptide fractions were analyzed by LC-MS using a linear ion trap-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. MS/MS and neutral loss-directed MS/MS/MS analysis allowed detection and sequencing of phosphopeptides with exceptional accuracy and specificity. Of more than 700 identified phosphopeptides, 139 were differentially regulated at least 2-fold in response to mating pheromone. Among these regulated proteins were components belonging to the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and to downstream processes including transcriptional regulation, the establishment of polarized growth, and the regulation of the cell cycle.},

abstract = {YidC of Echerichia coli, a member of the conserved Alb3/Oxa1/YidC family, is postulated to be important for biogenesis of membrane proteins. Here, we use as a model the lactose permease (LacY), a membrane transport protein with a known three-dimensional structure, to determine whether YidC plays a role in polytopic membrane protein insertion and/or folding. Experiments in vivo and with an in vitro transcription/translation/insertion system demonstrate that YidC is not necessary for insertion per se, but plays an important role in folding of LacY. By using the in vitro system and two monoclonal antibodies directed against conformational epitopes, LacY is shown to bind the antibodies poorly in YidC-depleted membranes. Moreover, LacY also folds improperly in proteoliposomes prepared without YidC. However, when the proteoliposomes are supplemented with purified YidC, LacY folds correctly. The results indicate that YidC plays a primary role in folding of LacY into its final tertiary conformation via an interaction that likely occurs transiently during insertion into the lipid phase of the membrane.},

title = {Differential regulation of the three methanol methyltransferase isozymes in Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A},
abstract = {Genetic analysis of the three methanol-specific methyltransferase 1 operons (mtaCB1, mtaCB2, and mtaCB3) in Methanosarcina acetivorans led to the suggestion that each of them has a discrete function during growth on methanol, which might be reflected in differential gene regulation (Pritchett and Metcalf, Mol. Microbiol. 56:1183-1194, 2005). To test this suggestion, reporter gene fusions were constructed for each of the three operons, and their expression was examined under various growth conditions. Expression of the mtaCB1 and mtaCB2 fusions was 100-fold and 575-fold higher, respectively, in methanol-grown cells than in trimethylamine (TMA)-grown cells. The mtaCB3 fusion was expressed at low levels on methanol, TMA, and dimethylamine but was significantly upregulated on monomethylamine and acetate. When TMA- or acetate-grown cultures were shifted to methanol, the mtaCB1 fusion was expressed most highly during exponential phase, whereas the mtaCB2 fusion, although strongly induced prior to mtaCB1 expression, did not reach full expression levels until stationary phase. The mtaCB3 fusion was transiently expressed prior to entry into exponential phase during a TMA-to-methanol substrate shift experiment. When acetate-grown cells were shifted to medium containing both TMA and methanol, TMA utilization commenced prior to utilization of methanol; however, these two substrates were consumed simultaneously later in growth. Under these conditions expression of the mtaCB2 and mtaCB3 fusions was delayed, suggesting that methylamines may repress their expression.},

abstract = {Many cellular components are present in such low numbers per cell that random births and deaths of individual molecules can cause substantial "noise" in concentrations. But biochemical events do not necessarily occur in single steps of individual molecules. Some processes are greatly randomized when synthesis or degradation occurs in large bursts of many molecules during a short time interval. Conversely, each birth or death of a macromolecule could involve several small steps, creating a memory between individual events. We present a generalized theory for stochastic gene expression, formulating the variance in protein abundance in terms of the randomness of the individual gene expression events. We show that common types of molecular mechanisms can produce gestation and senescence periods that reduce noise without requiring higher abundances, shorter lifetimes, or any concentration-dependent control loops. We also show that most single-cell experimental methods cannot distinguish between qualitatively different stochastic principles, although this in turn makes such methods better suited for identifying which components introduce fluctuations. Characterizing the random events that give rise to noise in concentrations instead requires dynamic measurements with single-molecule resolution.},

These methods account for statistics of dynamical paths between interfaces to enforce sampling of low probability regions of phase space for computing steady-state averages, including transition rates, for systems driven arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Recent advances in NEUS allow for efficient sampling of complex systems by focusing sampling in the vicinity of a one-dimensional manifold (string) that connects regions of interest in phase space; this procedure can be extended to the case of two strings that describe the forward and backward transition ensembles separately, which is useful, as they do not, in general, coincide. We recast FFS in the framework of NEUS to facilitate comparison of the two methods. We conclude by discussing selected applications of interest.},

The model includes catabolite repression, inducer exclusion, lactose hydrolysis to glucose and galactose, and synthesis and degradation of allolactose. Two models for catabolite repression were tested: (i) cyclic AMP (cAMP) synthesis inversely correlated with the external glucose concentration and (ii) synthesis inversely correlated with the glucose transport rate. No significant differences in the two models were observed. In addition to synthesis, degradation and secretion of cAMP were also included in the model. Two models for the phosphorylation of the glucose produced from lactose hydrolysis were also tested: (i) phosphorylation by intracellular hexokinase and (ii) secretion of glucose and subsequent phosphorylation upon transport back into the cell. The latter model resulted in weak catabolite repression when the glucose produced from lactose was transported out of the cell, whereas the former model showed no catabolite repression during growth on lactose. Parameter sensitivity analysis indicates the importance of key parameters to lac operon expression and cell growth: the lactose and allolactose transformation rates by beta-galactosidase and the glucose concentrations that affect catabolite repression and inducer exclusion. Large values of the allolactose hydrolysis rate resulted in low concentrations of allolactose, low-level expression of the lac operon, and slow growth due to limited import and metabolism of lactose; small values resulted in a high concentration of allolactose, high-level expression of the lac operon, and slow growth due to a limiting concentration of glucose 6-phosphate formed from allolactose. Changes in the rates of all beta-galactosidase-catalyzed reactions showed similar behavior, but had more drastic effects on the growth rate. Changes in the glucose concentration that inhibited lactose transport could extend or contract the diauxic growth period during growth in the presence of glucose and lactose. Moreover, changes in the glucose concentration that affected catabolite repression affected the cAMP levels and lac operon expression, but had a lesser effect on the growth rate.},

title = {Cell surface polarization during yeast mating},
abstract = {Exposure to mating pheromone in haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells results in the arrest of the cell cycle, expression of mating-specific genes, and polarized growth toward the mating partner. Proteins involved in signaling, polarization, cell adhesion, and fusion are localized to the tip of the mating cell (shmoo) where fusion will eventually occur. The mechanisms ensuring the correct targeting and retention of these proteins are poorly understood. Here we show that in pheromone-treated cells, a reorganization of the plasma membrane involving lipid rafts results in the retention of proteins at the tip of the mating projection, segregated from the rest of the membrane. Sphingolipid and ergosterol biosynthetic mutants fail to polarize proteins to the tip of the shmoo and are deficient in mating. Our results show that membrane microdomain clustering at the mating projection is involved in the generation and maintenance of polarity during mating.},

title = {Development of a markerless genetic exchange method for Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A and its use in construction of new genetic tools for methanogenic archaea},
abstract = {A new genetic technique for constructing mutants of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A by using hpt as a counterselectable marker was developed. Mutants with lesions in the hpt gene, encoding hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, were shown to be >35-fold more resistant to the toxic base analog 8-aza-2,6-diaminopurine (8ADP) than was the wild type. Reintroduction of the hpt gene into a Delta hpt host restored 8ADP sensitivity and provided the basis for a two-step strategy involving plasmid integration and excision for recombination of mutant alleles onto the M. acetivorans chromosome. We have designated this method markerless exchange because, although selectable markers are used during the process, they are removed in the final mutants. Thus, the method can be repeated many times in the same cell line. The method was validated by construction of Delta proC Delta hpt mutants, which were recovered at a frequency of 22%. Additionally, a Methanosarcina-Escherichia shuttle vector, encoding the Escherichia coli proC gene as a new selectable marker, was constructed for use in proC hosts. Finally, the markerless exchange method was used to recombine a series of uidA reporter gene fusions into the M. acetivorans proC locus. In vitro assay of beta-glucuronidase activity in extracts of these recombinants demonstrated, for the first time, the utility of uidA as a reporter gene in Methanosarcina: A >5,000-fold range of promoter activities could be measured by using uidA: the methyl-coenzyme M reductase operon fusion displayed approximately 300-fold-higher activity than did the serC gene fusion, which in turn had 16-fold-higher activity than did a fusion to the unknown orf2 gene.},

title = {Efficient anchoring of RNA polymerase in Escherichia coli during coupled transcription-translation of genes encoding integral inner membrane polypeptides},
abstract = {While it has been known that supercoiling of the DNA template can be induced by transcription, the mechanism and the efficiency of this process in vivo is not fully understood. We report here that transcription of genes encoding 16 S rRNA, a stable RNA species, or cytoplasmic polypeptides leads to very little or no detectable DNA supercoiling even under the optimum conditions in Escherichia coli. This indicates that hydrodynamic drag on the transcription complex (including RNA polymerase, nascent RNA, ribosomes, and nascent polypeptides) is not sufficient to anchor RNA polymerase during coupled transcription-translation. On the other hand, transcription of membrane-associated genes encoding integral inner membrane or exported periplasmic polypeptides leads to apparent DNA supercoiling. Transcription of genes encoding integral inner membrane polypeptides leads to significantly greater anchoring of RNA polymerase than does transcription of genes encoding periplasmic polypeptides. This may reflect differences in the coupling of transcription-translation with membrane association during expression of these two classes of polypeptides. Evidence is further presented to suggest that the anchoring of RNA polymerase is probably achieved through the interaction of nascent polypeptides with the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane during coupled transcription-translation. Moreover, transcriptions of a membrane-associated gene can, under certain circumstances, induce topological anchoring of an RNA polymerase transcribing a neighboring gene that ordinarily is not membrane-associated. Finally, the potential biological consequences of our findings are discussed.},

abstract = {The intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression can lead to a large variability of protein levels across a population of cells. Variability (or noise) in protein distributions can be modulated by cellular mechanisms of gene regulation; in particular, there is considerable interest in understanding the role of post-transcriptional regulation. To address this issue, we propose and analyze a stochastic model for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The analytical solution of the model provides insight into the effects of different mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation on the noise in protein distributions. The results obtained also demonstrate how different sources of intrinsic noise in gene expression can be discriminated based on observations of regulated protein distributions.},

The potential of individual yeast cells to switch between different growth modes is advantageous for optimal dissemination, protection and substrate colonization at the population level. A crucial step in lifestyle adaptation is the control of self- and foreign adhesion. For this purpose, S. cerevisiae contains a set of cell wall-associated proteins, which confer adhesion to diverse biotic and abiotic surfaces. Here, we provide an overview of different aspects of S. cerevisiae adhesion, including a detailed description of known lifestyles, recent insights into adhesin structure and function and an outline of the complex regulatory network for adhesin gene regulation. Our review shows that S. cerevisiae is a model system suitable for studying not only the mechanisms and regulation of cell adhesion, but also the role of this process in microbial development, ecology and evolution.},

The basic idea behind this model is from Paulsson's proposition (J. Paulsson, Phys. Life Rev. 2005, 2, 157-175), where the synthesis and degradation of a mRNA species corresponding to a target protein are regulated directly and indirectly by a certain sigma-factor, and a random increase in the concentration of the sigma-factor should increase both the synthesis and degradation rates of the mRNA species (bidirectional regulation). Using the standard Omega-expansion technique (linear noise approximation) and Monte Carlo simulation, our main results show clearly that for the steady-state statistics the effects of the noise of the sigma-factor on the stochastic fluctuation of the target protein could partially cancel out.},

title = {Functional states of the genome-scale Escherichia coli transcriptional regulatory system},
abstract = {A transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) constitutes the collection of regulatory rules that link environmental cues to the transcription state of a cell's genome. We recently proposed a matrix formalism that quantitatively represents a system of such rules (a transcriptional regulatory system [TRS]) and allows systemic characterization of TRS properties. The matrix formalism not only allows the computation of the transcription state of the genome but also the fundamental characterization of the input-output mapping that it represents. Furthermore, a key advantage of this "pseudo-stoichiometric" matrix formalism is its ability to easily integrate with existing stoichiometric matrix representations of signaling and metabolic networks. Here we demonstrate for the first time how this matrix formalism is extendable to large-scale systems by applying it to the genome-scale Escherichia coli TRS. We analyze the fundamental subspaces of the regulatory network matrix (R) to describe intrinsic properties of the TRS. We further use Monte Carlo sampling to evaluate the E. coli transcription state across a subset of all possible environments, comparing our results to published gene expression data as validation. Finally, we present novel in silico findings for the E. coli TRS, including (1) a gene expression correlation matrix delineating functional motifs; (2) sets of gene ontologies for which regulatory rules governing gene transcription are poorly understood and which may direct further experimental characterization; and (3) the appearance of a distributed TRN structure, which is in stark contrast to the more hierarchical organization of metabolic networks.},

abstract = {A dual approach consisting of cultivation and molecular retrieval of partial archaeal 16S rRNA genes was carried out to characterize the diversity and structure of the methanogenic community inhabiting the anoxic bulk soil of flooded rice microcosms. The molecular approach identified four groups of known methanogens. Three environmental sequences clustered with Methanobacterium bryantii and Methanobacterium formicicum, six were closely related but not identical to those of strains of Methanosaeta concilii, two grouped with members of the genus Methanosarcina, and two were related to the methanogenic endosymbiont of Plagiopyla nasuta. The cultivation approach via most-probable-number counts with a subsample of the same soil as an inoculum yielded cell numbers of up to 10(7) per g of dry soil for the H2-CO2-utilizing methanogens and of up to 10(6) for the acetate-utilizing methanogens. Strain VeH52, isolated from the terminal positive dilution on H2-CO2, grouped within the phylogenetic radiation characterized by M. bryantii and M. formicicum and the environmental sequences of the Methanobacterium-like group. A consortium of two distinct methanogens grew in the terminal positive culture on acetate. These two organisms showed absolute 16S rRNA gene identities with environmental sequences of the novel Methanosaeta-like group and the Methanobacterium-like group. Methanosarcina spp. were identified only in the less-dilute levels of the same dilution series on acetate. These data correlate well with acetate concentrations of about 11 microM in the pore water of this rice paddy soil. These concentrations are too low for the growth of known Methanosarcina spp. but are at the acetate utilization threshold of Methanosaeta spp. Thus, our data indicated Methanosaeta spp. and Methanobacterium spp. to be the dominant methanogenic groups in the anoxic rice soil, whereas Methanosarcina spp. appeared to be less abundant.},

abstract = {Crystal structures of the Lac repressor, with and without isopropyithiogalactoside (IPTG), and the repressor bound to operator have provided a model for how the binding of the inducer reduces the affinity of the repressor for the operator. However, because of the low resolution of the operator-bound structure (4.8 A), the model for the allosteric transition was presented in terms of structural elements rather than in terms of side chain interactions. Here we have constructed a dimeric Lac repressor and determined its structure at 2.6 A resolution in complex with a symmetric operator and the anti-inducer orthonitrophenylfucoside (ONPF).

However, these molecules often exist in low copy numbers and are difficult to detect in single cells. We carried out quantitative system-wide analyses of protein and mRNA expression in individual cells with single-molecule sensitivity using a newly constructed yellow fluorescent protein fusion library for Escherichia coli. We found that almost all protein number distributions can be described by the gamma distribution with two fitting parameters which, at low expression levels, have clear physical interpretations as the transcription rate and protein burst size. At high expression levels, the distributions are dominated by extrinsic noise. We found that a single cell's protein and mRNA copy numbers for any given gene are uncorrelated.},

abstract = {Most cellular processes depend on intracellular locations and random collisions of individual protein molecules. To model these processes, we developed algorithms to simulate the diffusion, membrane interactions, and reactions of individual molecules, and implemented these in the Smoldyn program. Compared to the popular MCell and ChemCell simulators, we found that Smoldyn was in many cases more accurate, more computationally efficient, and easier to use. Using Smoldyn, we modeled pheromone response system signaling among yeast cells of opposite mating type. This model showed that secreted Bar1 protease might help a cell identify the fittest mating partner by sharpening the pheromone concentration gradient. This model involved about 200,000 protein molecules, about 7000 cubic microns of volume, and about 75 minutes of simulated time; it took about 10 hours to run. Over the next several years, as faster computers become available, Smoldyn will allow researchers to model and explore systems the size of entire bacterial and smaller eukaryotic cells.},

title = {Enzymology of one-carbon metabolism in methanogenic pathways},
abstract = {Methanoarchaea, the largest and most phylogenetically diverse group in the Archaea domain, have evolved energy-yielding pathways marked by one-carbon biochemistry featuring novel cofactors and enzymes. All of the pathways have in common the two-electron reduction of methyl-coenzyme M to methane catalyzed by methyl-coenzyme M reductase but deviate in the source of the methyl group transferred to coenzyme M. Most of the methane produced in nature derives from acetate in a pathway where the activated substrate is cleaved by CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase and the methyl group is transferred to coenzyme M via methyltetrahydromethanopterin or methyltetrahydrosarcinapterin. Electrons for reductive demethylation of the methyl-coenzyme M originate from oxidation of the carbonyl group of acetate to carbon dioxide by the synthase. In the other major pathway, formate or H2 is oxidized to provide electrons for reduction of carbon dioxide to the methyl level and reduction of methyl-coenzyme to methane. Methane is also produced from the methyl groups of methanol and methylamines. In these pathways specialized methyltransferases transfer the methyl groups to coenzyme M. Electrons for reduction of the methyl-coenzyme M are supplied by oxidation of the methyl groups to carbon dioxide by a reversal of the carbon dioxide reduction pathway. Recent progress on the enzymology of one-carbon reactions in these pathways has raised the level of understanding with regard to the physiology and molecular biology of methanogenesis. These advances have also provided a foundation for future studies on the structure/function of these novel enzymes and exploitation of the recently completed sequences for the genomes from the methanoarchaea Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and Methanococcus jannaschii.},

title = {Origins of extrinsic variability in eukaryotic gene expression},
abstract = {Variable gene expression within a clonal population of cells has been implicated in a number of important processes including mutation and evolution, determination of cell fates and the development of genetic disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that a significant component of expression variability arises from extrinsic factors thought to influence multiple genes simultaneously, yet the biological origins of this extrinsic variability have received little attention. Here we combine computational modelling with fluorescence data generated from multiple promoter-gene inserts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify two major sources of extrinsic variability. One unavoidable source arising from the coupling of gene expression with population dynamics leads to a ubiquitous lower limit for expression variability. A second source, which is modelled as originating from a common upstream transcription factor, exemplifies how regulatory networks can convert noise in upstream regulator expression into extrinsic noise at the output of a target gene. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay of gene regulatory networks with population heterogeneity for understanding the origins of cellular diversity.},

title = {Spatial epigenetic control of mono- and bistable gene expression},
abstract = {Bistability in signaling networks is frequently employed to promote stochastic switch-like transitions between cellular differentiation states. Differentiation can also be triggered by antagonism of activators and repressors mediated by epigenetic processes that constitute regulatory circuits anchored to the chromosome. Their regulatory logic has remained unclear. A reaction-diffusion model reveals that the same reaction mechanism can support both graded monostable and switch-like bistable gene expression, depending on whether recruited repressor proteins generate a single silencing gradient or two interacting gradients that flank a gene. Our experiments confirm that chromosomal recruitment of activator and repressor proteins permits a plastic form of control; the stability of gene expression is determined by the spatial distribution of silencing nucleation sites along the chromosome. The unveiled regulatory principles will help to understand the mechanisms of variegated gene expression, to design synthetic genetic networks that combine transcriptional regulatory motifs with chromatin-based epigenetic effects, and to control cellular differentiation.},

title = {Spiral architecture of the nucleoid in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus},
abstract = {We present a cryo-electron tomographic analysis of the three-dimensional architecture of a strain of the Gram-negative bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus in which endogenous MreB2 was replaced with monomeric teal fluorescent protein (mTFP)-labeled MreB2. In contrast to wild-type Bdellovibrio cells that predominantly displayed a compact nucleoid region, cells expressing mTFP-labeled MreB2 displayed a twisted spiral organization of the nucleoid. The more open structure of the MreB2-mTFP nucleoids enabled clear in situ visualization of ribosomes decorating the periphery of the nucleoid. Ribosomes also bordered the edges of more compact nucleoids from both wild-type cells and mutant cells. Surprisingly, MreB2-mTFP localized to the interface between the spiral nucleoid and the cytoplasm, suggesting an intimate connection between nucleoid architecture and MreB arrangement. Further, in contrast to wild-type cells, where a single tight chemoreceptor cluster localizes close to the single polar flagellum, MreB2-mTFP cells often displayed extended chemoreceptor arrays present at one or both poles and displayed multiple or inaccurately positioned flagella. Our findings provide direct structural evidence for spiral organization of the bacterial nucleoid and suggest a possible role for MreB in regulation of nucleoid architecture and localization of the chemotaxis apparatus.},

abstract = {The transport and chemical reactions of solutes are modelled as a cellular automation in which molecules of different species perform a random walk on a regular lattice and react according to a local probabilistic rule. The model describes advection and diffusion in a simple way, and as no restriction is placed on the number of particles at a lattice site, it is also to describe a wide variety of chemical reactions. Assuming molecular chaos and a smooth density function, we obtain the standard reaction-transport equations in the continuum limit. Simulations on one- and two-dimensional lattices show that the discrete model can be used to approximate the solutions of the continuum equations. We discuss discrepancies which arise from correlations between molecules and how these disappear as the continuum limit is approached. Of particular interest are simulations displaying long-time behaviour which depends on long-wavelength statistical fluctuations not accounted for by the standard equations. The model is applied to the reactions a + b reversible c and a + b --> c with homogeneous and inhomogeneous initial conditions as well as to systems subject to autocatalytic reactions and displaying spontaneous formation of spatial concentration patterns.},

title = {Single mRNA molecules demonstrate probabilistic movement in living mammalian cells},
abstract = {Cytoplasmic mRNA movements ultimately determine the spatial distribution of protein synthesis. Although some mRNAs are compartmentalized in cytoplasmic regions, most mRNAs, such as housekeeping mRNAs or the poly-adenylated mRNA population, are believed to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The general mechanism by which all mRNAs may move, and how this may be related to localization, is unknown. Here, we report a method to visualize single mRNA molecules in living mammalian cells, and we report that, regardless of any specific cytoplasmic distribution, individual mRNA molecules exhibit rapid and directional movements on microtubules. Importantly, the beta-actin mRNA zipcode increased both the frequency and length of these movements, providing a common mechanistic basis for both localized and nonlocalized mRNAs. Disruption of the cytoskeleton with drugs showed that microtubules and microfilaments are involved in the types of mRNA movements we have observed, which included complete immobility and corralled and nonrestricted diffusion. Individual mRNA molecules switched frequently among these movements, suggesting that mRNAs undergo continuous cycles of anchoring, diffusion, and active transport.},

title = {Cdv-based cell division and cell cycle organization in the thaumarchaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus},
abstract = {Cell division is mediated by different mechanisms in different evolutionary lineages. While bacteria and euryarchaea utilize an FtsZ-based mechanism, most crenarchaea divide using the Cdv system, related to the eukaryotic ESCRT-III machinery. Intriguingly, thaumarchaeal genomes encode both FtsZ and Cdv protein homologues, raising the question of their division mode. Here, we provide evidence indicating that Cdv is the primary division system in the thaumarchaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus. We also show that the cell cycle is differently organized as compared to hyperthermophilic crenarchaea, with a longer pre-replication phase and a shorter post-replication stage. In particular, the time required for chromosome replication is remarkably extensive, 15 - 18 hr, indicating a low replication rate. Further, replication did not continue to termination in a significant fraction of N. maritimus cell populations following substrate depletion. Both the low replication speed and the propensity for replication arrest are likely to represent adaptations to extremely oligotrophic environments. The results demonstrate that thaumarchaea, crenarchaea and euryarchaea display differences not only regarding phylogenetic affiliations and gene content, but also in fundamental cellular and physiological characteristics. The findings also have implications for evolutionary issues concerning the last archaeal common ancestor and the relationship between archaea and eukaryotes.},

title = {Organization of the Smallest Eukaryotic Spindle},
abstract = {In metazoans, plants, and fungi, the spindle checkpoint delays mitosis until each chromosome is attached to one or more of its own kinetochore microtubules (kMTs). Some unicellular eukaryotes, however, have been reported to have fewer kMTs than chromosomes [1-5]. If this is the case, it is unclear how the spindle checkpoint could be satisfied. In the vast majority of the previous studies, mitotic cells were chemically fixed at room temperature, but this does not always preserve dynamic and/or small structures like spindle MTs and kinetochores [6]. Indeed, later higher-resolution studies have reversed some earlier claims [7-11]. Here we show that in Ostreococcus tauri (the smallest eukaryote known), mitosis does involve fewer spindle microtubules than chromosomes. O. tauri cultures were enriched for mitotic cells, high-pressure frozen, and then imaged in 3D both in plastic and in a near-native ("frozen-hydrated") state through electron tomography. Mitotic cells have a distinctive intranuclear heterochromatin-free "spindle tunnel" with approximately four short and occasionally one long, incomplete (unclosed) microtubule at each end of the spindle tunnel. Because other aspects of O. tauri's spindle checkpoint seem typical, these data suggest that O. tauri's 20 chromosomes are physically linked and segregated as just one or a small number of groups.},

title = {VMD: visual molecular dynamics},
abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

However, this does not take into account the fact that methanogens with cytochromes have considerably higher growth yields and threshold concentrations for H(2) than methanogens without cytochromes. These and other differences can be explained by the proposal outlined in this Review that in methanogens with cytochromes, the first and last steps in methanogenesis from CO(2) are coupled chemiosmotically, whereas in methanogens without cytochromes, these steps are energetically coupled by a cytoplasmic enzyme complex that mediates flavin-based electron bifurcation.},

abstract = {The volume of a typical Eschericia coli nucleoid is roughly 10(4) times smaller than the volume of a freely coiling linear DNA molecule with the same length as the E. coli genome. We review the main forces that have been suggested to contribute to this compaction factor: macromolecular crowding (that "pushes" the DNA together), DNA charge neutralization by various polycationic species (that "glues" the DNA together), and finally, DNA deformations due to DNA supercoiling and nucleoid proteins. The direct contributions of DNA supercoiling and nucleoid proteins to the total compaction factor are probably small. Instead, we argue that the formation of the bacterial nucleoid can be described as a consequence of the influence of macromolecular crowding on thick, supercoiled protein-DNA fibers, that have been partly charge neutralized by small multivalent cations.},

title = {Noise-based switches and amplifiers for gene expression},
abstract = {The regulation of cellular function is often controlled at the level of gene transcription. Such genetic regulation usually consists of interacting networks, whereby gene products from a single network can act to control their own expression or the production of protein in another network. Engineered control of cellular function through the design and manipulation of such networks lies within the constraints of current technology. Here we develop a model describing the regulation of gene expression and elucidate the effects of noise on the formulation. We consider a single network derived from bacteriophage lambda and construct a two-parameter deterministic model describing the temporal evolution of the concentration of lambda repressor protein. Bistability in the steady-state protein concentration arises naturally, and we show how the bistable regime is enhanced with the addition of the first operator site in the promotor region. We then show how additive and multiplicative external noise can be used to regulate expression. In the additive case, we demonstrate the utility of such control through the construction of a protein switch, whereby protein production is turned "on" and "off" by using short noise pulses. In the multiplicative case, we show that small deviations in the transcription rate can lead to large fluctuations in the production of protein, and we describe how these fluctuations can be used to amplify protein production significantly. These results suggest that an external noise source could be used as a switch and/or amplifier for gene expression. Such a development could have important implications for gene therapy.},

title = {New methods for tightly regulated gene expression and highly efficient chromosomal integration of cloned genes for Methanosarcina species},
abstract = {A highly efficient method for chromosomal integration of cloned DNA into Methanosarcina spp. was developed utilizing the site-specific recombination system from the Streptomyces phage phiC31. Host strains expressing the phiC31 integrase gene and carrying an appropriate recombination site can be transformed with non-replicating plasmids carrying the complementary recombination site at efficiencies similar to those obtained with self-replicating vectors. We have also constructed a series of hybrid promoters that combine the highly expressed M. barkeri PmcrB promoter with binding sites for the tetracycline-responsive, bacterial TetR protein. These promoters are tightly regulated by the presence or absence of tetracycline in strains that express the tetR gene. The hybrid promoters can be used in genetic experiments to test gene essentiality by placing a gene of interest under their control. Thus, growth of strains with tetR-regulated essential genes becomes tetracycline-dependent. A series of plasmid vectors that utilize the site-specific recombination system for construction of reporter gene fusions and for tetracycline regulated expression of cloned genes are reported. These vectors were used to test the efficiency of translation at a variety of start codons. Fusions using an ATG start site were the most active, whereas those using GTG and TTG were approximately one half or one fourth as active, respectively. The CTG fusion was 95% less active than the ATG fusion.},

abstract = {The fluctuation-dissipation theorem, one of the central theorems in thermal dynamics, breaks down in out-of-equilibrium systems. The idea of effective temperature coming from the extensions of that theorem has been recently introduced to study glasses and has proved to be a key concept for out-of-equilibrium systems. Gene networks involve stochastic chemical kinetics and are far from equilibrium. This leads us to try to use the notion of effective temperature to study them. To develop this idea, we study a simple birth-death process and a general two-species interacting process using the language of effective temperature. Furthermore, a model of a nonregulatory gene is studied as an example. The effective temperature may serves as an alternative and somewhat more fundamental language to describe the intrinsic-extrinsic noise distinction that has already provided a tool for qualifying gene networks.},

title = {Modeling robustness tradeoffs in yeast cell polarization induced by spatial gradients},
abstract = {Cells localize (polarize) internal components to specific locations in response to external signals such as spatial gradients. For example, yeast cells form a mating projection toward the source of mating pheromone. There are specific challenges associated with cell polarization including amplification of shallow external gradients of ligand to produce steep internal gradients of protein components (e.g. localized distribution), response over a broad range of ligand concentrations, and tracking of moving signal sources. In this work, we investigated the tradeoffs among these performance objectives using a generic model that captures the basic spatial dynamics of polarization in yeast cells, which are small. We varied the positive feedback, cooperativity, and diffusion coefficients in the model to explore the nature of this tradeoff. Increasing the positive feedback gain resulted in better amplification, but also produced multiple steady-states and hysteresis that prevented the tracking of directional changes of the gradient. Feedforward/feedback coincidence detection in the positive feedback loop and multi-stage amplification both improved tracking with only a modest loss of amplification. Surprisingly, we found that introducing lateral surface diffusion increased the robustness of polarization and collapsed the multiple steady-states to a single steady-state at the cost of a reduction in polarization. Finally, in a more mechanistic model of yeast cell polarization, a surface diffusion coefficient between 0.01 and 0.001 µm(2)/s produced the best polarization performance, and this range is close to the measured value. The model also showed good gradient-sensitivity and dynamic range. This research is significant because it provides an in-depth analysis of the performance tradeoffs that confront biological systems that sense and respond to chemical spatial gradients, proposes strategies for balancing this tradeoff, highlights the critical role of lateral diffusion of proteins in the membrane on the robustness of polarization, and furnishes a framework for future spatial models of yeast cell polarization.},

title = {Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression far from equilibrium: Omega expansion and linear noise approximation},
abstract = {The Omega expansion of the master equation is used to investigate the intrinsic noise in an autoregulatory gene expression system. This Omega expansion provides a mesoscale description of the system and is used to analyze the effect of feedback regulation on intrinsic noise when the system state is far from equilibrium. Using the linear noise approximation, analytic results are obtained for a single gene system with linear feedback that is far from equilibrium. Additionally, analytic expressions are obtained for nonlinear systems near equilibrium. Simulations of such autoregulatory reaction schemes with nonlinear feedback show that during the approach to equilibrium the noise is not always reduced by the strength of the feedback. This is contrary to results seen in the equilibrium limit which show decreased noise with feedback strength. These results demonstrate that the behavior of linearized systems near equilibrium cannot be readily applied to systems far from equilibrium and highlight the need to explore nonequilibrium domains in mesoscopic systems.},

title = {Gene expression profiling of Escherichia coli growth transitions: an expanded stringent response model},
abstract = {When conditions cause bacterial growth to stop, extensive reprogramming of physiology and gene expression allows for the cell's survival. We used whole-genome DNA arrays to determine the system response in Escherichia coli cells experiencing transient growth arrest caused by glucose-lactose diauxie and H2O2 treatment, and also entry into stationary phase. The results show that growth-arrested cells induce stringent control of several gene systems. The vast majority of genes encoding the transcription and translation apparatus immediately downregulate, followed by a global return to steady state when growth resumes. Approximately one-half of the amino acid biosynthesis genes downregulate during growth arrest, with the notable exception of the his operon, which transiently upregulates in the diauxie experiment. Nucleotide biosynthesis downregulates, a result that is again consistent with the stringent response. Likewise, aerobic metabolism downregulates during growth arrest, and the results led us to suggest a model for stringent control of the ArcA regulon. The stationary phase stress response fully induces during growth arrest, whether transient or permanent, in a manner consistent with known mechanisms related to stringent control. Cells similarly induce the addiction module anti-toxin and toxin genes during growth arrest; the latter are known to inhibit translation and DNA replication. The results indicate that in all aspects of the response cells do not distinguish between transient and potentially permanent growth arrest (stationary phase). We introduce an expanded model for the stringent response that integrates induction of stationary phase survival genes and inhibition of transcription, translation and DNA replication. Central to the model is the reprogramming of transcription by guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which provides for the cell's rapid response to growth arrest and, by virtue of its brief half-life, the ability to quickly resume growth as changing conditions allow.},

The emerging field "physics of living matter" is addressing active material properties of the cytoskeleton and tissues like the spontaneous generation of stress, which may lead to shape changes and tissue flows, and their implications for embryonic development. Here, we discuss spontaneous mechanical oscillations to present some basic elements for understanding this physics, and we illustrate its application to developing embryos.

Here, we extend the use of FCS to low concentrations of coding RNAs in single living cells. We genetically fuse a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene and two binding sites for an RNA-binding protein, whose translated product is the RFP protein alone. Using this construct, we determine in single cells both the absolute [mRNA] concentration and the associated [RFP] expressed from an inducible plasmid. We find that the FCS method allows us to reliably monitor in real-time [mRNA] down to approximately 40 nM (i.e. approximately two transcripts per volume of detection). To validate these measurements, we show that [mRNA] is proportional to the associated expression of the RFP protein. This FCS-based technique establishes a framework for minimally invasive measurements of mRNA concentration in individual living bacteria.},

title = {Interplay between Intrinsic Noise and the Stochasticity of the Cell Cycle in Bacterial Colonies},
abstract = {Herein we report on the effects that different stochastic contributions induce in bacterial colonies in terms of protein concentration and production. In particular, we consider for what we believe to be the first time cell-to-cell diversity due to the unavoidable randomness of the cell-cycle duration and its interplay with other noise sources. To that end, we model a recent experimental setup that implements a protein dilution protocol by means of division events to characterize the gene regulatory function at the single cell level. This approach allows us to investigate the effect of different stochastic terms upon the total randomness experimentally reported for the gene regulatory function. In addition, we show that the interplay between intrinsic fluctuations and the stochasticity of the cell-cycle duration leads to different constructive roles. On the one hand, we show that there is an optimal value of protein concentration (alternatively an optimal value of the cell cycle phase) such that the noise in protein concentration attains a minimum. On the other hand, we reveal that there is an optimal value of the stochasticity of the cell cycle duration such that the coherence of the protein production with respect to the colony average production is maximized. The latter can be considered as a novel example of the recently reported phenomenon of diversity induced resonance.},

At least three pathways are involved in regulating the transition between these two forms in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and evidence is now emerging that homologous signalling modules are involved in regulating filament formation and virulence in a range of human and plant fungal pathogens. Strikingly, components used to signal sexual differentiation in the response to mating pheromones are often reutilized to regulate dimorphic development, suggesting an ancient link between these processes.},

abstract = {The lac operon has been a paradigm for genetic regulation with positive feedback, and several modeling studies have described its dynamics at various levels of detail. However, it has not yet been analyzed how stochasticity can enrich the system's behavior, creating effects that are not observed in the deterministic case. To address this problem we use a comparative approach. We develop a reaction network for the dynamics of the lac operon genetic switch and derive corresponding deterministic and stochastic models that incorporate biological details. We then analyze the effects of key biomolecular mechanisms, such as promoter strength and binding affinities, on the behavior of the models. No assumptions or approximations are made when building the models other than those utilized in the reaction network. Thus, we are able to carry out a meaningful comparison between the predictions of the two models to demonstrate genuine effects of stochasticity. Such a comparison reveals that in the presence of stochasticity, certain biomolecular mechanisms can profoundly influence the region where the system exhibits bistability, a key characteristic of the lac operon dynamics. For these cases, the temporal asymptotic behavior of the deterministic model remains unchanged, indicating a role of stochasticity in modulating the behavior of the system.},

abstract = {Most genes are regulated by multiple transcription factors that bind specific sites in DNA regulatory regions. These cis-regulatory regions perform a computation: the rate of transcription is a function of the active concentrations of each of the input transcription factors. Here, we used accurate gene expression measurements from living cell cultures, bearing GFP reporters, to map in detail the input function of the classic lacZYA operon of Escherichia coli, as a function of about a hundred combinations of its two inducers, cAMP and isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG). We found an unexpectedly intricate function with four plateau levels and four thresholds. This result compares well with a mathematical model of the binding of the regulatory proteins cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and LacI to the lac regulatory region. The model is also used to demonstrate that with few mutations, the same region could encode much purer AND-like or even OR-like functions. This possibility means that the wild-type region is selected to perform an elaborate computation in setting the transcription rate. The present approach can be generally used to map the input functions of other genes.},

title = {Comparative genomics reveals 104 candidate structured RNAs from bacteria, archaea, and their metagenomes},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structured noncoding RNAs perform many functions that are essential for protein synthesis, RNA processing, and gene regulation. Structured RNAs can be detected by comparative genomics, in which homologous sequences are identified and inspected for mutations that conserve RNA secondary structure.

RESULTS: By applying a comparative genomics-based approach to genome and metagenome sequences from bacteria and archaea, we identified 104 candidate structured RNAs and inferred putative functions for many of these. Twelve candidate metabolite-binding RNAs were identified, three of which were validated, including one reported herein that binds the coenzyme S-adenosylmethionine. Newly identified cis-regulatory RNAs are implicated in photosynthesis or nitrogen regulation in cyanobacteria, purine and one-carbon metabolism, stomach infection by Helicobacter, and many other physiological processes. A candidate riboswitch termed crcB is represented in both bacteria and archaea. Another RNA motif may control gene expression from 3'-untranslated regions of mRNAs, which is unusual for bacteria. Many noncoding RNAs that likely act in trans are also revealed, and several of the noncoding RNA candidates are found mostly or exclusively in metagenome DNA sequences.

CONCLUSIONS: This work greatly expands the variety of highly structured noncoding RNAs known to exist in bacteria and archaea and provides a starting point for biochemical and genetic studies needed to validate their biologic functions. Given the sustained rate of RNA discovery over several similar projects, we expect that far more structured RNAs remain to be discovered from bacterial and archaeal organisms.},

title = {Green's-function reaction dynamics: a particle-based approach for simulating biochemical networks in time and space},
abstract = {We have developed a new numerical technique, called Green's-function reaction dynamics (GFRD), that makes it possible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level and in both time and space. In this scheme, a maximum time step is chosen such that only single particles or pairs of particles have to be considered. For these particles, the Smoluchowski equation can be solved analytically using Green's functions. The main idea of GFRD is to exploit the exact solution of the Smoluchoswki equation to set up an event-driven algorithm, which combines in one step the propagation of the particles in space with the reactions between them. The event-driven nature allows GFRD to make large jumps in time and space when the particles are far apart from each other. Here, we apply the technique to a simple model of gene expression. The simulations reveal that spatial fluctuations can be a major source of noise in biochemical networks. The calculations also show that GFRD is highly efficient. Under biologically relevant conditions, GFRD is up to five orders of magnitude faster than conventional particle-based techniques for simulating biochemical networks in time and space. GFRD is not limited to biochemical networks. It can also be applied to a large number of other reaction-diffusion problems.},

abstract = {How folding of proteins is coupled to their synthesis remains poorly understood. Here, we apply single-molecule fluorescence imaging to full protein synthesis in vitro. Ribosomes were specifically immobilized onto glass surfaces and synthesis of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was achieved using modified commercial Protein Synthesis using Recombinant Elements that lacked ribosomes but contained purified factors and enzyme that are required for translation in Escherichia coli. Translation was monitored using a GFP mutant (F64L/S65T/F99S/M153T/V163A) that has a high fluorophore maturation rate and that contained the Secretion Monitor arrest sequence to prevent dissociation from the ribosome. Immobilized ribosomal subunits were labeled with Cy3 and GFP synthesis was measured by colocalization of GFP fluorescence with the ribosome position. The rate of appearance of colocalized ribosome GFP was equivalent to the rates of fluorescence appearance coupled with translation measured in bulk, and the ribosome-polypeptide complexes were stable for hours. The methods presented here are applicable to single-molecule investigation of translational initiation, elongation and cotranslational folding.},

title = {The effect of stochasticity on the lac operon: an evolutionary perspective},
abstract = {The role of stochasticity on gene expression is widely discussed. Both potential advantages and disadvantages have been revealed. In some systems, noise in gene expression has been quantified, in among others the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Whether stochastic gene expression in this system is detrimental or beneficial for the cells is, however, still unclear. We are interested in the effects of stochasticity from an evolutionary point of view. We study this question in the lac operon, taking a computational approach: using a detailed, quantitative, spatial model, we evolve through a mutation-selection process the shape of the promoter function and therewith the effective amount of stochasticity. We find that noise values for lactose, the natural inducer, are much lower than for artificial, nonmetabolizable inducers, because these artificial inducers experience a stronger positive feedback. In the evolved promoter functions, noise due to stochasticity in gene expression, when induced by lactose, only plays a very minor role in short-term physiological adaptation, because other sources of population heterogeneity dominate. Finally, promoter functions evolved in the stochastic model evolve to higher repressed transcription rates than those evolved in a deterministic version of the model. This causes these promoter functions to experience less stochasticity in gene expression. We show that a high repression rate and hence high stochasticity increases the delay in lactose uptake in a variable environment. We conclude that the lac operon evolved such that the impact of stochastic gene expression is minor in its natural environment, but happens to respond with much stronger stochasticity when confronted with artificial inducers. In this particular system, we have shown that stochasticity is detrimental. Moreover, we demonstrate that in silico evolution in a quantitative model, by mutating the parameters of interest, is a promising way to unravel the functional properties of biological systems.},

title = {The membrane-bound electron transport system of Methanosarcina species},
abstract = {Members of the genus Methanosarcina are strictly anaerobic archaea that derive their metabolic energy from the conversion of a restricted number of substrates to methane. H2 + CO2 are converted to CH4 via the CO2-reducing pathway, while methanol and methylamines are metabolized by the methylotrophic pathway. Two novel electron transport systems are involved in the process of methanogenesis. Both systems are able to use a heterodisulfide as electron acceptor and either H2 or F420H2 as electron acceptors and generate a proton-motive force by redox potential-driven H(+)-translocation. The H2:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase is composed of an F420-nonreducing hydrogenase and the heterodisulfide reductase. The latter protein is also part of the F420H2:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase system. The second component of this system is referred to as F420H2 dehydrogenase. The archaeal protein is a homologue of complex I of the respiratory chain from bacteria and mitochondria. This review focuses on the biochemical and genetic characteristics of the three energy-transducing enzymes and on the mechanisms of ion translocation.},

We use this information to identify network motifs, the simplest units of network architecture, and demonstrate that an automated process can use motifs to assemble a transcriptional regulatory network structure. Our results reveal that eukaryotic cellular functions are highly connected through networks of transcriptional regulators that regulate other transcriptional regulators.},

abstract = {Yeast cells respond to spatial gradients of mating pheromones by polarizing and pro- jecting up the gradient toward the source. It is thought that they employ a spatial sensing mechanism in which the cell compares the concentration of pheromone at different points on the cell surface and determines the maximum point, where the pro- jection forms. Here we constructed the first spatial mathematical model of the yeast pheromone response that describes the dynamics of the heterotrimeric and Cdc42p G-protein cycles, which are linked in a cascade. Two key performance objectives of this system are (1) amplification---converting a shallow external gradient of ligand to a steep internal gradient of protein components and (2) tracking---following changes in gradient direction. We used simulations to investigate amplification mechanisms that allow tracking. We identified specific strategies for regulating the spatial dynamics of the protein components (i.e. their changing location in the cell) that would enable the cell to achieve both objectives.},

title = {Stochasticity in transcriptional regulation: origins, consequences, and mathematical representations},
abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is an inherently noisy process. The origins of this stochastic behavior can be traced to the random transitions among the discrete chemical states of operators that control the transcription rate and to finite number fluctuations in the biochemical reactions for the synthesis and degradation of transcripts. We develop stochastic models to which these random reactions are intrinsic and a series of simpler models derived explicitly from the first as approximations in different parameter regimes. This innate stochasticity can have both a quantitative and qualitative impact on the behavior of gene-regulatory networks. We introduce a natural generalization of deterministic bifurcations for classification of stochastic systems and show that simple noisy genetic switches have rich bifurcation structures; among them, bifurcations driven solely by changing the rate of operator fluctuations even as the underlying deterministic system remains unchanged. We find stochastic bistability where the deterministic equations predict monostability and vice-versa. We derive and solve equations for the mean waiting times for spontaneous transitions between quasistable states in these switches.},

abstract = {We report on the first, to our knowledge, successful detection of a fluorescent unnatural amino acid (fUAA), Lys(BODIPYFL), incorporated into a membrane protein (the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, nAChR) in a living cell. Xenopus oocytes were injected with a frameshift-suppressor tRNA, amino-acylated with Lys(BODIPYFL) and nAChR (alpha/beta19'GGGU/gamma/delta) mRNAs. We measured fluorescence from oocytes expressing nAChR beta19'Lys(BODIPYFL), using time-resolved total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Under conditions of relatively low receptor density (<0.1 receptors/microm(2)), we observed puncta with diffraction-limited profiles that were consistent with the point-spread function of our microscope. Furthermore, diffraction-limited puncta displayed step decreases in fluorescence intensity, consistent with single-molecule photobleaching. The puncta densities agreed with macroscopic ACh-induced current densities, showing that the fUAA was incorporated, and that receptors were functional. Dose-response relations for the nAChR beta19'Lys(BODIPYFL) receptors were similar to those for wild-type receptors. We also studied nAChR beta19'Lys(BODIPYFL) receptors labeled with alpha-bungarotoxin monoconjugated with Alexa488 (alphaBtxAlexa488). The nAChR has two alphaBtx binding sites, and puncta containing the Lys(BODIPYFL) labeled with alphaBtxAlexa488 yielded the expected three discrete photobleaching steps. We also performed positive control experiments with a nAChR containing enhanced green fluorescent protein in the gamma-subunit M3-M4 loop, which confirmed our nAChR beta19'Lys(BODIPYFL) measurements. Thus, we report on the cell-based single-molecule detection of nAChR beta19'Lys(BODIPYFL).},

We present here a global study of changes in mRNA abundance in response to hydrogen availability for a hydrogenotrophic methanogen. Cells of Methanococcus maripaludis were grown by using continuous culture to deconvolute the effects of hydrogen limitation and growth rate, and microarray analyses were conducted. Hydrogen limitation markedly increased mRNA levels for genes encoding enzymes of the methanogenic pathway that reduce or oxidize the electron-carrying deazaflavin, coenzyme F(420). F(420)-dependent redox functions in energy-generating metabolism are characteristic of the methanogenic Archaea, and the results show that their regulation is distinct from other redox processes in the cell.

title = {Behavior of a metabolic cycling population at the single cell level as visualized by fluorescent gene expression reporters},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: During continuous growth in specific chemostat cultures, budding yeast undergo robust oscillations in oxygen consumption that are accompanied by highly periodic changes in transcript abundance of a majority of genes, in a phenomenon called the Yeast Metabolic Cycle (YMC). This study uses fluorescent reporters of genes specific to different YMC phases in order to visualize this phenomenon and understand the temporal regulation of gene expression at the level of individual cells within the cycling population.

METHODOLOGY: Fluorescent gene expression reporters for different phases of the YMC were constructed and stably integrated into the yeast genome. Subsequently, these reporter-expressing yeast were used to visualize YMC dynamics at the individual cell level in cultures grown in a chemostat or in a microfluidics platform under varying glucose concentrations, using fluorescence microscopy and quantitative Western blots.

CONCLUSIONS: The behavior of single cells within a metabolic cycling population was visualized using phase-specific fluorescent reporters. The reporters largely recapitulated genome-specified mRNA expression profiles. A significant fraction of the cell population appeared to exhibit basal expression of the reporters, supporting the hypothesis that there are at least two distinct subpopulations of cells within the cycling population. Although approximately half of the cycling population initiated cell division in each permissive window of the YMC, metabolic synchrony of the population was maintained. Using a microfluidics platform we observed that low glucose concentrations appear to be necessary for metabolic cycling. Lastly, we propose that there is a temporal window in the oxidative growth phase of the YMC where the cycling population segregates into at least two subpopulations, one which will enter the cell cycle and one which does not.},

abstract = {The cellular environment is abuzz with noise originating from the inherent random motion of reacting molecules in the living cell. In this noisy environment, clonal cell populations show cell-to-cell variability that can manifest significant phenotypic differences. Noise-induced stochastic fluctuations in cellular constituents can be measured and their statistics quantified. We show that these random fluctuations carry within them valuable information about the underlying genetic network. Far from being a nuisance, the ever-present cellular noise acts as a rich source of excitation that, when processed through a gene network, carries its distinctive fingerprint that encodes a wealth of information about that network. We show that in some cases the analysis of these random fluctuations enables the full identification of network parameters, including those that may otherwise be difficult to measure. This establishes a potentially powerful approach for the identification of gene networks and offers a new window into the workings of these networks.},

title = {Pre-dispositions and epigenetic inheritance in the Escherichia coli lactose operon bistable switch},
abstract = {The lactose operon regulation in Escherichia coli is a primary model of phenotypic switching, reminiscent of cell fate determination in higher organisms. Under conditions of bistability, an isogenic cell population partitions into two subpopulations, with the operon's genes turned on or remaining off. It is generally hypothesized that the final state of a cell depends solely on stochastic fluctuations of the network's protein concentrations, particularly on bursts of lactose permease expression. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the cell switching decision are not fully understood. We designed a microfluidic system to follow the formation of a transiently bimodal population within growing microcolonies. The analysis of genealogy and cell history revealed the existence of pre-disposing factors for switching that are epigenetically inherited. Both the pre-induction expression stochasticity of the lactose operon repressor LacI and the cellular growth rate are predictive factors of the cell's response upon induction, with low LacI concentration and slow growth correlating with higher switching probability. Thus, stochasticity at the local level of the network and global physiology are synergistically involved in cell response determination.},

abstract = {Protein levels have been shown to vary substantially between individual cells in clonal populations. In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in Escherichia coli by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations.},

abstract = {A new fluorescent compound, factor(420) (F(420)), which is involved in the hydrogen metabolism of hydrogen-grown Methanobacterium strain M.o.H. has been isolated and purified. Acid hydrolysis of this compound with 6 m HCl for 24 hr releases a ninhydrin-positive compound (glutamic acid), an acid-stable chromophore, phosphate, and an ether-soluble phenolic component. Factor(420) may be reduced by either sodium dithionite or sodium borohydride at pH 7.3 with concomitant loss of its fluorescence and its major absorption peak at 420 nm. Crude cell-free extracts of strain M.o.H. reduce F(420) only under a hydrogen atmosphere. F(420) is photolabile aerobically in neutral and basic solutions, whereas the acid-stable chromophore is not photolabile under these conditions. An approximate molecular weight of 630 +/- 8% for F(420) was determined by Sephadex G-25 chromatography. At the present time, F(420) is proposed as a trivial name for the unknown fluorescent compound because of its strong absorption maximum of 420 nm at pH 7.},

title = {A synthetic three-color scaffold for monitoring genetic regulation and noise},
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Current methods for analyzing the dynamics of natural regulatory networks, and quantifying synthetic circuit function, are limited by the lack of well-characterized genetic measurement tools. Fluorescent reporters have been used to measure dynamic gene expression, but attempts to monitor multiple genes simultaneously in single cells are relatively recent and have not focused on independent, isolated measurements. Multiple reporters can be used to observe interactions between natural genes, or to facilitate the 'debugging' of biologically engineered genetic networks. Using three distinguishable reporter genes in a single cell can reveal information not obtainable from only one or two reporters. One application of multiple reporters is the use of genetic noise to reveal regulatory connections between genes. Experiments in both natural and synthetic systems would benefit from a well-characterized platform for expressing multiple reporter genes and synthetic network components. RESULTS: We describe such a plasmid-based platform for the design and optimization of synthetic gene networks, and for analysis of endogenous gene networks. This network scaffold consists of three distinguishable fluorescent reporter genes controlled by inducible promoters, with conveniently placed restriction sites to make modifications straightforward. We quantitatively characterize the scaffold in Escherichia coli with single-cell fluorescence imaging and time-lapse microscopy. The three spectrally distinct reporters allow independent monitoring of genetic regulation and analysis of genetic noise. As a novel application of this tool we show that the presence of genetic noise can reveal transcriptional co-regulation due to a hidden factor, and can distinguish constitutive from regulated gene expression. CONCLUSION: We have constructed a general chassis where three promoters from natural genes or components of synthetic networks can be easily inserted and independently monitored on a single construct using optimized fluorescent protein reporters. We have quantitatively characterized the baseline behavior of the chassis so that it can be used to measure dynamic gene regulation and noise. Overall, the system will be useful both for analyzing natural genetic networks and assembling synthetic ones.},

title = {Robust growth of Escherichia coli},
abstract = {The quantitative study of the cell growth has led to many fundamental insights in our understanding of a wide range of subjects, from the cell cycle to senescence. Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically and symmetrically dividing organisms, implying that a "steady-state" population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 10(5) individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death.},

abstract = {Analysis of genetic and functional variability in populations of living cells requires experimental techniques capable of monitoring cellular processes such as cell signaling of many single cells in parallel while offering the possibility to sort interesting cell phenotypes for further investigations. Although flow cytometry is able to sequentially probe and sort thousands of cells per second, dynamic processes cannot be experimentally accessed on single cells due to the sub-second sampling time. Cellular dynamics can be measured by image cytometry of surface-immobilized cells, however, cell sorting is complicated under these conditions due to cell attachment. We here developed a cytometric tool based on refractive multiple optical tweezers combined with microfluidics and optical microscopy. We demonstrate contact-free immobilization of more than 200 yeast cells into a high-density array of optical traps in a microfluidic chip. The cell array could be moved to specific locations of the chip enabling us to expose in a controlled manner the cells to reagents and to analyze the responses of individual cells in a highly parallel format using fluorescence microscopy. We further established a method to sort single cells within the microfluidic device using an additional steerable optical trap. Ratiometric fluorescence imaging of intracellular pH of trapped yeast cells allowed us on the one hand to measure the effect of the trapping laser on the cells' viability and on the other hand to probe the dynamic response of the cells upon glucose sensing.},

title = {Dynamic SpoIIIE assembly mediates septal membrane fission during Bacillus subtilis sporulation},
abstract = {SpoIIIE is an FtsK-related protein that transports the forespore chromosome across the Bacillus subtilis sporulation septum. We use membrane photobleaching and protoplast assays to demonstrate that SpoIIIE is required for septal membrane fission in the presence of trapped DNA, and that DNA is transported across separate daughter cell membranes, suggesting that SpoIIIE forms a channel that partitions the daughter cell membranes. Our results reveal a close correlation between septal membrane fission and the assembly of a stable SpoIIIE translocation complex at the septal midpoint. Time-lapse epifluorescence, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and live-cell photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM) demonstrate that the SpoIIIE transmembrane domain mediates dynamic localization to active division sites, whereas the assembly of a stable focus also requires the cytoplasmic domain. The transmembrane domain fails to completely separate the membrane, and it assembles unstable foci. TIRF microscopy and biophysical modeling of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) data suggest that this unstable protein transitions between disassembled and assembled oligomeric states. We propose a new model for the role of SpoIIIE assembly in septal membrane fission that has strong implications for how the chromosome terminus crosses the septum.},

Complexes similar to the methanoreductosome in the methanogenic bacterium G{\"o} 1 were also found attached to the inner aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane of Methanococcus voltae. Methanoreductosomes were purified from crude extracts of G{\"o} 1-cells by affinity chromatography.

abstract = {Gene expression originates from individual DNA molecules within living cells. Like many single-molecule processes, gene expression and regulation are stochastic, that is, sporadic in time. This leads to heterogeneity in the messenger-RNA and protein copy numbers in a population of cells with identical genomes. With advanced single-cell fluorescence microscopy, it is now possible to quantify transcriptomes and proteomes with single-molecule sensitivity. Dynamic processes such as transcription-factor binding, transcription and translation can be monitored in real time, providing quantitative descriptions of the central dogma of molecular biology and the demonstration that a stochastic single-molecule event can determine the phenotype of a cell.},

title = {A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators},
abstract = {Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential functions in living cells, but the 'design principles' underlying the functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of relatively simple systems. Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

title = {Anomalous diffusion of proteins due to molecular crowding},
abstract = {We have studied the diffusion of tracer proteins in highly concentrated random-coil polymer and globular protein solutions imitating the crowded conditions encountered in cellular environments. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the anomalous diffusion exponent alpha characterizing the dependence of the mean-square displacement of the tracer proteins on time, r(2)(t) approximately t(alpha). We observed that the diffusion of proteins in dextran solutions with concentrations up to 400 g/l is subdiffusive (alpha < 1) even at low obstacle concentration. The anomalous diffusion exponent alpha decreases continuously with increasing obstacle concentration and molecular weight, but does not depend on buffer ionic strength, and neither does it depend strongly on solution temperature. At very high random-coil polymer concentrations, alpha reaches a limit value of alpha(l) approximately 3/4, which we take to be the signature of a coupling between the motions of the tracer proteins and the segments of the dextran chains. A similar, although less pronounced, subdiffusive behavior is observed for the diffusion of streptavidin in concentrated globular protein solutions. These observations indicate that protein diffusion in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus should be anomalous as well, with consequences for measurements of solute diffusion coefficients in cells and for the modeling of cellular processes relying on diffusion.},

Integration of the organizational elements provides an experimentally annotated transcription unit architecture, including alternative transcription start sites, 5' untranslated region, boundaries and open reading frames of each transcription unit. A total of 4,661 transcription units were identified, representing an increase of >530% over current knowledge. This comprehensive transcription unit architecture allows for the elucidation of condition-specific uses of alternative sigma factors at the genome scale. Furthermore, the transcription unit architecture provides a foundation on which to construct genome-scale transcriptional and translational regulatory networks.},

title = {The effects of replacing Sst2 with the heterologous RGS4 on polarization and mating in yeast},
abstract = {RGS proteins stimulate the deactivation of heterotrimeric G-proteins. The yeast RGS protein Sst2 is regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. We replaced the SST2 gene with the distantly related human RGS4 gene, which consists of the catalytic domain and an N-terminal membrane attachment peptide, and replaced the native promoter (P(SST2)) with the heterologous tetracycline-repressible promoter (P(TET)). We then measured the effect of the substitutions on pheromone sensitivity, mating, and polarization. Although the pheromone sensitivity was essentially normal, there were differences in mating and polarization. In particular, the RGS4-substituted strains did not form multiple mating projections at high levels of alpha-factor, but instead formed a single malformed projection, which frequently gave rise to a bud. We provide evidence that this phenotype arose because unlike Sst2, RGS4 did not localize to the projection. We use mathematical modeling to argue that localization of Sst2 to the projection prevents excess G-protein activation during the pheromone response. In addition, modeling and experiments demonstrate that the dose of Sst2 influences the frequency of mating projection formation.},

title = {Reconciliation of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for comparative systems analysis},
abstract = {In the past decade, over 50 genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have been built for a variety of single- and multi- cellular organisms. These reconstructions have enabled a host of computational methods to be leveraged for systems-analysis of metabolism, leading to greater understanding of observed phenotypes. These methods have been sparsely applied to comparisons between multiple organisms, however, due mainly to the existence of differences between reconstructions that are inherited from the respective reconstruction processes of the organisms to be compared. To circumvent this obstacle, we developed a novel process, termed metabolic network reconciliation, whereby non-biological differences are removed from genome-scale reconstructions while keeping the reconstructions as true as possible to the underlying biological data on which they are based. This process was applied to two organisms of great importance to disease and biotechnological applications, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida, respectively. The result is a pair of revised genome-scale reconstructions for these organisms that can be analyzed at a systems level with confidence that differences are indicative of true biological differences (to the degree that is currently known), rather than artifacts of the reconstruction process. The reconstructions were re-validated with various experimental data after reconciliation. With the reconciled and validated reconstructions, we performed a genome-wide comparison of metabolic flexibility between P. aeruginosa and P. putida that generated significant new insight into the underlying biology of these important organisms. Through this work, we provide a novel methodology for reconciling models, present new genome-scale reconstructions of P. aeruginosa and P. putida that can be directly compared at a network level, and perform a network-wide comparison of the two species. These reconstructions provide fresh insights into the metabolic similarities and differences between these important Pseudomonads, and pave the way towards full comparative analysis of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of multiple species.},

abstract = {The environment significantly influences the dynamic expression and assembly of all components encoded in the genome of an organism into functional biological networks. We have constructed a model for this process in Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 through the data-driven discovery of regulatory and functional interrelationships among approximately 80% of its genes and key abiotic factors in its hypersaline environment. Using relative changes in 72 transcription factors and 9 environmental factors (EFs) this model accurately predicts dynamic transcriptional responses of all these genes in 147 newly collected experiments representing completely novel genetic backgrounds and environments-suggesting a remarkable degree of network completeness. Using this model we have constructed and tested hypotheses critical to this organism's interaction with its changing hypersaline environment. This study supports the claim that the high degree of connectivity within biological and EF networks will enable the construction of similar models for any organism from relatively modest numbers of experiments.},

abstract = {A simple model of gene regulation in response to stochastically changing environmental conditions is developed and analyzed. The model consists of a differential equation driven by a continuous time 2-state Markov process. The density function of the resulting process converges to a beta distribution. We show that the moments converge to their stationary values exponentially in time. Simulations of a two-stage process where protein production depends on mRNA concentrations are also presented demonstrating that protein concentration tracks the environment whenever the rate of protein turnover is larger than the rate of environmental change. Single-celled organisms are therefore expected to have relatively high mRNA and protein turnover rates for genes that respond to environmental fluctuations.},

title = {Single-virus tracking reveals a spatial receptor-dependent search mechanism},
abstract = {Viral infection begins with the binding of a virus to a specific target on the surface of the host cell, followed by viral genome delivery into the host and a continuation of the infection process. Before binding occurs, the virus must first find its receptor by a process whose details are largely unknown. We applied high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and single-particle tracking to elucidate the target-finding process in bacteriophage λ as it infects an Escherichia coli cell. By monitoring the motion of individual viruses through the early stages of infection, we identified a unique spatial focusing process that allows a virus to arrive from its initial random landing site to its destination at the cell pole. The search process is governed by the interaction between the virus and the LamB receptors, and by the spatial organization of the receptor network on the cell surface. Our findings allowed us to develop a theoretical model for the target-finding process that reproduces the key features observed in experiment. We discuss the possible implications of our findings for the process of viral receptor-finding in higher systems.},

title = {Stochastic kinetic analysis of developmental pathway bifurcation in phage lambda-infected Escherichia coli cells},
abstract = {Fluctuations in rates of gene expression can produce highly erratic time patterns of protein production in individual cells and wide diversity in instantaneous protein concentrations across cell populations. When two independently produced regulatory proteins acting at low cellular concentrations competitively control a switch point in a pathway, stochastic variations in their concentrations can produce probabilistic pathway selection, so that an initially homogeneous cell population partitions into distinct phenotypic subpopulations. Many pathogenic organisms, for example, use this mechanism to randomly switch surface features to evade host responses. This coupling between molecular-level fluctuations and macroscopic phenotype selection is analyzed using the phage lambda lysis-lysogeny decision circuit as a model system. The fraction of infected cells selecting the lysogenic pathway at different phage:cell ratios, predicted using a molecular-level stochastic kinetic model of the genetic regulatory circuit, is consistent with experimental observations. The kinetic model of the decision circuit uses the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, stochastic mechanisms of gene expression, and a statistical-thermodynamic model of promoter regulation. Conventional deterministic kinetics cannot be used to predict statistics of regulatory systems that produce probabilistic outcomes. Rather, a stochastic kinetic analysis must be used to predict statistics of regulatory outcomes for such stochastically regulated systems.},

Each new riboswitch discovery expands our knowledge of the biochemical capabilities of RNA, and some give rise to new questions that require additional study to be addressed.

title = {Minimal gene regulatory circuits for a lysis-lysogeny choice in the presence of noise},
abstract = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that make reliable decisions should have design features to cope with random fluctuations in the levels or activities of biological molecules. The phage λ GRN makes a lysis-lysogeny decision informed by the number of phages infecting the cell. To analyse the design of decision making GRNs, we generated random in silico GRNs comprised of two or three transcriptional regulators and selected those able to perform a λ-like decision in the presence of noise. Various two-protein networks analogous to the λ CI-Cro GRN worked in noise-less conditions but failed when noise was introduced. Adding a λ CII-like protein significantly improved robustness to noise. CII relieves the CI-like protein of its 'decider' function, allowing CI to be optimized as a decision 'maintainer'. CII's lysogenic decider function was improved by its instability and rapid removal once the decision was taken, preventing its interference with maintenance. A more reliable decision also resulted from simulated co-transcription of the genes for CII and the Cro-like protein, which correlates fluctuations in these opposing decider functions and makes their ratio less noisy. Thus, the λ decision network contains design features for reducing and resisting noise.},

abstract = {Brownian Dynamics algorithms have been widely used for simulating systems in soft-condensed matter physics. In recent times, their application has been extended to the simulation of coarse-grained models of biochemical networks. In these models, components move by diffusion and interact with one another upon contact. However, when reactions are incorporated into a Brownian dynamics algorithm, care must be taken to avoid violations of the detailed-balance rule, which would introduce systematic errors in the simulation. We present a Brownian dynamics algorithm for simulating reaction-diffusion systems that rigorously obeys detailed balance for equilibrium reactions. By comparing the simulation results to exact analytical results for a bimolecular reaction, we show that the algorithm correctly reproduces both equilibrium and dynamical quantities. We apply our scheme to a "push-pull" network in which two antagonistic enzymes covalently modify a substrate. Our results highlight that spatial fluctuations of the network components can strongly reduce the gain of the response of a biochemical network.},

title = {Stochastic switching in gene networks can occur by a single-molecule event or many molecular steps},
abstract = {Due to regulatory feedback, biological networks can exist stably in multiple states, leading to heterogeneous phenotypes among genetically identical cells. Random fluctuations in protein numbers, tuned by specific molecular mechanisms, have been hypothesized to drive transitions between these different states. We develop a minimal theoretical framework to analyze the limits of switching in terms of simple experimental parameters. Our model identifies and distinguishes between two distinct molecular mechanisms for generating stochastic switches. In one class of switches, the stochasticity of a single-molecule event, a specific and rare molecular reaction, directly controls the macroscopic change in a cell's state. In the second class, no individual molecular event is significant, and stochasticity arises from the propagation of biochemical noise through many molecular pathways and steps. As an example, we explore switches based on protein-DNA binding fluctuations and predict relations between transcription factor kinetics, absolute switching rate, robustness, and efficiency that differentiate between switching by single-molecule events or many molecular steps. Finally, we apply our methods to recent experimental data on switching in Escherichia coli lactose metabolism, providing quantitative interpretations of a single-molecule switching mechanism.},

title = {Predicting stochastic gene expression dynamics in single cells},
abstract = {Fluctuations in protein numbers (noise) due to inherent stochastic effects in single cells can have large effects on the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks. Although deterministic models can predict the average network behavior, they fail to incorporate the stochasticity characteristic of gene expression, thereby limiting their relevance when single cell behaviors deviate from the population average. Recently, stochastic models have been used to predict distributions of steady-state protein levels within a population but not to predict the dynamic, presteady-state distributions. In the present work, we experimentally examine a system whose dynamics are heavily influenced by stochastic effects. We measure population distributions of protein numbers as a function of time in the Escherichia coli lactose uptake network (lac operon). We then introduce a dynamic stochastic model and show that prediction of dynamic distributions requires only a few noise parameters in addition to the rates that characterize a deterministic model. Whereas the deterministic model cannot fully capture the observed behavior, our stochastic model correctly predicts the experimental dynamics without any fit parameters. Our results provide a proof of principle for the possibility of faithfully predicting dynamic population distributions from deterministic models supplemented by a stochastic component that captures the major noise sources.},

title = {Growth rate-dependent global effects on gene expression in bacteria},
abstract = {Bacterial gene expression depends not only on specific regulatory mechanisms, but also on bacterial growth, because important global parameters such as the abundance of RNA polymerases and ribosomes are all growth-rate dependent. Understanding of these global effects is necessary for a quantitative understanding of gene regulation and for the design of synthetic genetic circuits. We find that the observed growth-rate dependence of constitutive gene expression can be explained by a simple model using the measured growth-rate dependence of the relevant cellular parameters. More complex growth dependencies for genetic circuits involving activators, repressors, and feedback control were analyzed and verified experimentally with synthetic circuits. Additional results suggest a feedback mechanism mediated by general growth-dependent effects that does not require explicit gene regulation if the expressed protein affects cell growth. This mechanism can lead to growth bistability and promote the acquisition of important physiological functions such as antibiotic resistance and tolerance (persistence).},

abstract = {Many important physiological processes operate at time and space scales far beyond those accessible to atom-realistic simulations, and yet discrete stochastic rather than continuum methods may best represent finite numbers of molecules interacting in complex cellular spaces. We describe and validate new tools and algorithms developed for a new version of the MCell simulation program (MCell3), which supports generalized Monte Carlo modeling of diffusion and chemical reaction in solution, on surfaces representing membranes, and combinations thereof. A new syntax for describing the spatial directionality of surface reactions is introduced, along with optimizations and algorithms that can substantially reduce computational costs (e.g., event scheduling, variable time and space steps). Examples for simple reactions in simple spaces are validated by comparison to analytic solutions. Thus we show how spatially realistic Monte Carlo simulations of biological systems can be far more cost-effective than often is assumed, and provide a level of accuracy and insight beyond that of continuum methods.},

title = {Comparison of three methyl-coenzyme M reductases from phylogenetically distant organisms: unusual amino acid modification, conservation and adaptation},
abstract = {The nickel enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzes the terminal step of methane formation in the energy metabolism of all methanogenic archaea. In this reaction methyl-coenzyme M and coenzyme B are converted to methane and the heterodisulfide of coenzyme M and coenzyme B. The crystal structures of methyl-coenzyme M reductase from Methanosarcina barkeri (growth temperature optimum, 37 degrees C) and Methanopyrus kandleri (growth temperature optimum, 98 degrees C) were determined and compared with the known structure of MCR from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (growth temperature optimum, 65 degrees C). The active sites of MCR from M. barkeri and M. kandleri were almost identical to that of M. thermoautotrophicum and predominantly occupied by coenzyme M and coenzyme B. The electron density at 1.6 A resolution of the M. barkeri enzyme revealed that four of the five modified amino acid residues of MCR from M. thermoautotrophicum, namely a thiopeptide, an S-methylcysteine, a 1-N-methylhistidine and a 5-methylarginine were also present. Analysis of the environment of the unusual amino acid residues near the active site indicates that some of the modifications may be required for the enzyme to be catalytically effective. In M. thermoautotrophicum and M. kandleri high temperature adaptation is coupled with increasing intracellular concentrations of lyotropic salts. This was reflected in a higher fraction of glutamate residues at the protein surface of the thermophilic enzymes adapted to high intracellular salt concentrations.},

All of the 1149 reactions included in this in silico model are both elementally and charge balanced and have been assigned to one of eight cellular locations (extracellular space, cytosol, mitochondrion, peroxisome, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, or vacuole). When in silico predictions of 4154 growth phenotypes were compared to two published large-scale gene deletion studies, an 83% agreement was found between iND750's predictions and the experimental studies. Analysis of the failure modes showed that false predictions were primarily caused by iND750's limited inclusion of cellular processes outside of metabolism. This study systematically identified inconsistencies in our knowledge of yeast metabolism that require specific further experimental investigation.},

title = {Accurate particle-based simulation of adsorption, desorption and partial transmission},
abstract = {Particle-based simulators represent molecules of interest with point-like particles that diffuse and react in continuous space. These simulators are often used to investigate spatial or stochastic aspects of biochemical systems. This paper presents new particle-based simulation algorithms for modeling interactions between molecules and surfaces; they address irreversible and reversible molecular adsorption to, desorption from and transmission through membranes. Their central elements are: (i) relationships between adsorption, desorption and transmission coefficients on the one hand, and simulator interaction probabilities on the other, and (ii) probability densities for initial placements of desorbed molecules. These algorithms, which were implemented and tested in the Smoldyn simulator, are accurate, easy to implement and computationally efficient. They allow longer time steps and better address reversible processes than an algorithm that Erban and Chapman recently presented (Physical Biology 4:16-28, 2007). This paper also presents a method for simulating unbounded diffusion in a limited spatial domain using a partially absorbing boundary, as well as new solutions to the diffusion differential equation with reversible Robin boundary conditions.},

In Escherichia coli, the targeting of secretory proteins to the inner membrane can be accomplished post-translationally. Unexpectedly, despite this variance, E. coli contains essential genes encoding Ffh and FtsY with a significant similarity to proteins of the eukaryotic SRP machinery. In this study, we investigated the possibility that the prokaryotic SRP-like machinery is involved in biogenesis of membrane proteins in E. coli. The data presented here demonstrate that the SRP-receptor homologue, FtsY, is indeed essential for expression of integral membrane proteins in E. coli, indicating that, in the case of this group of proteins, FtsY and the mammalian SRP receptor have similar functions.},

title = {Computational methods for diffusion-influenced biochemical reactions},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: We compare stochastic computational methods accounting for space and discrete nature of reactants in biochemical systems. Implementations based on Brownian dynamics (BD) and the reaction-diffusion master equation are applied to a simplified gene expression model and to a signal transduction pathway in Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In the regime where the number of molecules is small and reactions are diffusion-limited predicted fluctuations in the product number vary between the methods, while the average is the same. Computational approaches at the level of the reaction-diffusion master equation compute the same fluctuations as the reference result obtained from the particle-based method if the size of the sub-volumes is comparable to the diameter of reactants. Using numerical simulations of reversible binding of a pair of molecules we argue that the disagreement in predicted fluctuations is due to different modeling of inter-arrival times between reaction events. Simulations for a more complex biological study show that the different approaches lead to different results due to modeling issues. Finally, we present the physical assumptions behind the mesoscopic models for the reaction-diffusion systems.

title = {The role of co-transcriptional translation and protein translocation (transertion) in bacterial chromosome segregation},
abstract = {Many recent reviews in the field of bacterial chromosome segregation propose that newly replicated DNA is actively separated by the functioning of specific proteins. This view is primarily based on an interpretation of the position of fluorescently labelled DNA regions and proteins in analogy to the active segregation mechanism in eukaryotic cells, i.e. to mitosis. So far, physical aspects of DNA organization such as the diffusional movement of DNA supercoil segments and their interaction with soluble proteins, leading to a phase separation between cytoplasm and nucleoid, have received relatively little attention. Here, a quite different view is described taking into account DNA-protein interactions, the large variation in the cellular position of fluorescent foci and the compaction and fusion of segregated nucleoids upon inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis. It is proposed that the random diffusion of DNA supercoil segments is transiently constrained by the process of co- transcriptional translation and translocation (transertion) of membrane proteins. After initiation of DNA replication, a bias in the positioning of transertion areas creates a bidirectionality in chromosome segregation that becomes self-enhanced when neighbouring genes on the same daughter chromosome are expressed. This transertion-mediated segregation model is applicable to multifork replication during rapid growth and to multiple chromosomes and plasmids that occur in many bacteria.},

abstract = {Mycobacteria are responsible for a number of human and animal diseases and are classical intracellular pathogens, living inside macrophages rather than as free-living organisms during infection. Numerous intracellular pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, and Rickettsia rickettsii, exploit the host cytoskeleton by using actin-based motility for cell to cell spread during infection. Here we show that Mycobacterium marinum, a natural pathogen of fish and frogs and an occasional pathogen of humans, is capable of actively inducing actin polymerization within macrophages. M. marinum that polymerized actin were free in the cytoplasm and propelled by actin-based motility into adjacent cells. Immunofluorescence demonstrated the presence of host cytoskeletal proteins, including the Arp2/3 complex and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, throughout the actin tails. In contrast, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein localized exclusively at the actin-polymerizing pole of M. marinum. These findings show that M. marinum can escape into the cytoplasm of infected macrophages, where it can recruit host cell cytoskeletal factors to induce actin polymerization leading to direct cell to cell spread.},

title = {Equilibrium binding of inducer to lac repressor.operator DNA complex},
abstract = {The characteristics of inducer binding to lactose repressor protein in the presence of a small (29 base pair) operator DNA fragment have been examined. The presence of operator DNA fragments decreases the affinity of the protein for inducer molecules. The maximum change observed is a 20-fold increase in the concentration of inducer necessary for half-saturation of the protein. The non-linearity of the Scatchard type plots and slopes of the Hill plots of the binding data indicate that inducer binding exhibits cooperative behavior in the presence of operator DNA fragments, while free repressor binds inducer in a noncooperative fashion. The experimental data for the binding of inducer to repressor both in the presence and absence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments were compared to curves predicted by several different models. Using the limits placed by the measured values for repressor-operator DNA-inducer interaction, it was possible to discriminate between the various models. The models which accurately predicted the inducer binding curves and conformed to the measured values for the other parameters were Monod-Wyman-Changeux and Koshland type models with the following features: 1) positive cooperativity in the binding of inducer to the repressor . operator DNA complex; 2) two sites for the binding of the operator DNA fragment to repressor protein; 3) effect of binding of each operator DNA fragment on all four subunits of the repressor. These models are consistent with all of the available data, and they indicate that the binding of the first two inducer molecules accounts for greater than or equal to 60% of the difference in affinities between free and induced repressor for operator DNA; in vivo this difference should be sufficient for induction to occur.},

Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

title = {Macromolecular binding equilibria in the lac repressor system: studies using high-pressure fluorescence spectroscopy},
abstract = {High hydrostatic pressure coupled with fluorescence polarization has been used to investigate protein subunit interactions and protein-operator association in lac repressor labeled with a long-lived fluorescent probe. On the basis of observation of a concentration-dependent sigmoidal decrease in the dansyl fluorescence polarization, we conclude that application of high hydrostatic pressure results in dissociation of the lac repressor tetramer. The 2-fold decrease in the rotational relaxation time and the high-pressure plateau are consistent with a tetramer to dimer transition. The volume change for tetramer dissociation to dimer is -82 +/- 5 mL/mol. The dissociation constant calculated from the data taken at 4.5 degrees C is 4.3 +/- 1.3 nM. The tetramer dissociation constant increases by a factor of 3 when the temperature is raised from 4.5 to 21 degrees C. A very small effect of inducer binding on the subunit dissociation is observed at 4.5 degrees C; the Kd increases from 4.5 to 7.1 nM. At 21 degrees C, however, inducer binding stabilizes the tetramer by approximately 0.8 kcal/mol. Pressure-induced monomer formation is indicated by the curves obtained upon raising the pH to 9.2. The addition of IPTG shifts the pressure transition to only slightly higher pressures at this pH, indicating that the stabilization of the tetramer by inducer is not as marked as that observed at pH 7.1. From the decrease in the polarization of the dansyl repressor-operator complexes, we also conclude that the application of pressure results their dissociation and that the volume change is large in absolute value (approximately 200 mL/mol). The lac repressor-operator complex is more readily dissociated upon the application of pressure than the tetramer alone, indicating that operator binding destabilizes the lac repressor tetramer.},

title = {Universal architecture of bacterial chemoreceptor arrays},
abstract = {Chemoreceptors are key components of the high-performance signal transduction system that controls bacterial chemotaxis. Chemoreceptors are typically localized in a cluster at the cell pole, where interactions among the receptors in the cluster are thought to contribute to the high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, and precise adaptation of the signaling system. Previous structural and genomic studies have produced conflicting models, however, for the arrangement of the chemoreceptors in the clusters. Using whole-cell electron cryo-tomography, here we show that chemoreceptors of different classes and in many different species representing several major bacterial phyla are all arranged into a highly conserved, 12-nm hexagonal array consistent with the proposed "trimer of dimers" organization. The various observed lengths of the receptors confirm current models for the methylation, flexible bundle, signaling, and linker sub-domains in vivo. Our results suggest that the basic mechanism and function of receptor clustering is universal among bacterial species and was thus conserved during evolution.},

abstract = {An increasing number of experimental studies employ single particle tracking to probe the physical environment in complex systems. We here propose and discuss what we believe are new methods to analyze the time series of the particle traces, in particular, for subdiffusion phenomena. We discuss the statistical properties of mean maximal excursions (MMEs), i.e., the maximal distance covered by a test particle up to time t. Compared to traditional methods focusing on the mean-squared displacement we show that the MME analysis performs better in the determination of the anomalous diffusion exponent. We also demonstrate that combination of regular moments with moments of the MME method provides additional criteria to determine the exact physical nature of the underlying stochastic subdiffusion processes. We put the methods to test using experimental data as well as simulated time series from different models for normal and anomalous dynamics such as diffusion on fractals, continuous time random walks, and fractional Brownian motion.},

title = {Noise propagation and signaling sensitivity in biological networks: a role for positive feedback},
abstract = {Interactions between genes and proteins are crucial for efficient processing of internal or external signals, but this connectivity also amplifies stochastic fluctuations by propagating noise between components. Linear (unbranched) cascades were shown to exhibit an interplay between the sensitivity to changes in input signals and the ability to buffer noise. We searched for biological circuits that can maintain signaling sensitivity while minimizing noise propagation, focusing on cases where the noise is characterized by rapid fluctuations. Negative feedback can buffer this type of noise, but this buffering comes at the expense of an even greater reduction in signaling sensitivity. By systematically analyzing three-component circuits, we identify positive feedback as a central motif allowing for the buffering of propagated noise while maintaining sensitivity to long-term changes in input signals. We show analytically that noise reduction in the presence of positive feedback results from improved averaging of rapid fluctuations over time, and discuss in detail a particular implementation in the control of nutrient homeostasis in yeast. As the design of biological networks optimizes for multiple constraints, positive feedback can be used to improve sensitivity without a compromise in the ability to buffer propagated noise.},

abstract = {After hundreds of generations of adaptive evolution at exponential growth, Escherichia coli grows as predicted using flux balance analysis (FBA) on genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). However, it is not known whether the predicted pathway usage in FBA solutions is consistent with gene and protein expression in the wild-type and evolved strains. Here, we report that >98% of active reactions from FBA optimal growth solutions are supported by transcriptomic and proteomic data. Moreover, when E. coli adapts to growth rate selective pressure, the evolved strains upregulate genes within the optimal growth predictions, and downregulate genes outside of the optimal growth solutions. In addition, bottlenecks from dosage limitations of computationally predicted essential genes are overcome in the evolved strains. We also identify regulatory processes that may contribute to the development of the optimal growth phenotype in the evolved strains, such as the downregulation of known regulons and stringent response suppression. Thus, differential gene and protein expression from wild-type and adaptively evolved strains supports observed growth phenotype changes, and is consistent with GEM-computed optimal growth states.},

abstract = {The mating pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been the focus of considerable research effort, yet many quantitative aspects of its regulation still remain unknown. Using an integrated approach involving experiments in microfluidic chips and computational modelling, we studied gene expression and phenotypic changes associated with the mating response under well-defined pheromone gradients. Here we report a combination of switch-like and graded pathway responses leading to stochastic phenotype determination in a specific range of pheromone concentrations. Furthermore, we show that these responses are critically dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated regulation of the activity of the pheromone-response-specific transcription factor, Ste12, as well as on the autoregulatory feedback of Ste12. In particular, both the switch-like characteristics and sensitivity of gene expression in shmooing cells to pheromone concentration were significantly diminished in cells lacking Kss1, one of the MAP kinases activated in the mating pathway. In addition, the dynamic range of gradient sensing of Kss1-deficient cells was reduced compared with wild type. We thus provide unsuspected functional significance for this kinase in regulation of the mating response.},

We show that the Min oscillations, including mutant phenotypes, can be accounted for by in vitro-observed interactions involving MinD and MinE, with a crucial role played by the rate of nucleotide exchange. Recent discoveries suggest that protein oscillations may play a general role in proper chromosome and plasmid partitioning.},

title = {Investigating the effects of molecular crowding on Ca2+ diffusion using a particle-based simulation model},
abstract = {Calcium ions (Ca(2+)) are an important second messenger in eucaryotic cells. They are involved in numerous physiological processes which are triggered by calcium signals in the form of local release events, temporal oscillations, or reaction-diffusion waves. The diffusive spread of calcium signals in the cytosol is strongly affected by calcium-binding proteins (buffers). In addition, the cytosol contains a large number of inert molecules and molecular structures which make it a crowded environment. Here, we investigate the effects of such excluded volumes on calcium diffusion in the presence of different kinds of buffers. We find that the contributions in slowing down Ca(2+) diffusion coming from buffering and molecular crowding are not additive, i.e., the reduction in Ca(2+) diffusivity due to crowding and buffering together is not the sum of each single contribution. In the presence of Ca(2+) gradients and high affinity mobile buffers the effective diffusion coefficient of Ca(2+) can be reduced by up to 60% in highly crowded environments. This suggests that molecular crowding may significantly affect the shape of Ca(2+) microdomains and wave propagation in cell types with high excluded volume fractions.},

abstract = {Noise in gene expression is generated at multiple levels, such as transcription and translation, chromatin remodeling and pathway-specific regulation. Studies of individual promoters have suggested different dominating noise sources, raising the question of whether a general trend exists across a large number of genes and conditions. We examined the variation in the expression levels of 43 Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, in cells grown under 11 experimental conditions. For all classes of genes and under all conditions, the expression variance was approximately proportional to the mean; the same scaling was observed at steady state and during the transient responses to the perturbations. Theoretical analysis suggests that this scaling behavior reflects variability in mRNA copy number, resulting from random 'birth and death' of mRNA molecules or from promoter fluctuations. Deviation of coexpressed genes from this general trend, including high noise in stress-related genes and low noise in proteasomal genes, may indicate fluctuations in pathway-specific regulators or a differential activation pattern of the underlying gene promoters.},

By using the yeast galactose network as a model, we combinatorially deleted one of the two copies of its four regulatory genes and found that network activity was robust to the change in network dosage. A mathematical analysis revealed that a two-component genetic circuit with elements of opposite regulatory activity (activator and inhibitor) constitutes a minimal requirement for network-dosage invariance. Specific interaction topologies and a one-to-one interaction stoichiometry between the activating and inhibiting agents were additional essential elements facilitating dosage invariance. This mechanism of network-dosage invariance could represent a general design for gene network structure in cells.},

title = {A novel in vivo assay reveals inhibition of ribosomal nuclear export in ran-cycle and nucleoporin mutants},
abstract = {To identify components involved in the nuclear export of ribosomes in yeast, we developed an in vivo assay exploiting a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged version of ribosomal protein L25. After its import into the nucleolus, L25-GFP assembles with 60S ribosomal subunits that are subsequently exported into the cytoplasm. In wild-type cells, GFP-labeled ribosomes are only detected by fluorescence in the cytoplasm. However, thermosensitive rna1-1 (Ran-GAP), prp20-1 (Ran-GEF), and nucleoporin nup49 and nsp1 mutants are impaired in ribosomal export as revealed by nuclear accumulation of L25-GFP. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant-negative RanGTP (Gsp1-G21V) and the tRNA exportin Los1p inhibits ribosomal export. The pattern of subnuclear accumulation of L25-GFP observed in different mutants is not identical, suggesting that transport can be blocked at different steps.

title = {Dynamic analysis of integrated signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks},
abstract = {Extracellular cues affect signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes to elicit cellular responses. Although intracellular signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks are highly integrated, previous analyses have largely focused on independent processes (e.g., metabolism) without considering the interplay that exists among them. However, there is evidence that many diseases arise from multifunctional components with roles throughout signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks. Therefore, in this study, we propose a flux balance analysis (FBA)-based strategy, referred to as integrated dynamic FBA (idFBA), that dynamically simulates cellular phenotypes arising from integrated networks. The idFBA framework requires an integrated stoichiometric reconstruction of signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes. It assumes quasi-steady-state conditions for "fast" reactions and incorporates "slow" reactions into the stoichiometric formalism in a time-delayed manner. To assess the efficacy of idFBA, we developed a prototypic integrated system comprising signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes with network features characteristic of actual systems and incorporated kinetic parameters based on typical time scales observed in literature. idFBA was applied to the prototypic system, which was evaluated for different environments and gene regulatory rules. In addition, we applied the idFBA framework in a similar manner to a representative module of the single-cell eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ultimately, idFBA facilitated quantitative, dynamic analysis of systemic effects of extracellular cues on cellular phenotypes and generated comparable time-course predictions when contrasted with an equivalent kinetic model. Since idFBA solves a linear programming problem and does not require an exhaustive list of detailed kinetic parameters, it may be efficiently scaled to integrated intracellular systems that incorporate signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes at the genome scale, such as the S. cerevisiae system presented here.},

title = {Metabolic networks: a signal-oriented approach to cellular models},
abstract = {Complete genomes, far advanced proteomes, and even 'metabolomes' are available for at least a few organisms, e.g., Escherichia coli. Systematic functional analyses of such complete data sets will produce a wealth of information and promise an understanding of the dynamics of complex biological networks and perhaps even of entire living organisms. Such complete and holistic descriptions of biological systems, however, will increasingly require a quantitative analysis and the help of mathematical models for simulating whole systems. In particular, new procedures are required that allow a meaningful reduction of the information derived from complex systems that will consequently be used in the modeling process. In this review the biological elements of such a modeling procedure will be described. In a first step, complex living systems must be structured into well-defined and clearly delimited functional units, the elements of which have a common physiological goal, belong to a single genetic unit, and respond to the signals of a signal transduction system that senses changes in physiological states of the organism. These functional units occur at each level of complexity and more complex units originate by grouping several lower level elements into a single, more complex unit. To each complexity level corresponds a global regulator that is epistatic over lower level regulators. After its structuring into modules (functional units), a biological system is converted in a second step into mathematical submodels that by progressive combination can also be assembled into more aggregated model structures. Such a simplification of a cell (an organism) reduces its complexity to a level amenable to present modeling capacities. The universal biochemistry, however, promises a set of rules valid for modeling biological systems, from unicellular microorganisms and cells, to multicellular organisms and to populations.},

title = {Mechanisms and constraints on yeast MAPK signaling specificity},
abstract = {The survival of cells relies on their ability to respond specifically to diverse environmental signals. Surprisingly, intracellular signaling pathways often share the same or homologous protein components, yet undesirable crosstalk is, in general, suppressed. This signaling specificity has been well studied in the yeast model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are repeatedly employed in mediating distinct biological processes including pheromone-induced mating and filamentous growth under starvation. Although various mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the yeast MAPK signaling specificity, a consistent theory is still lacking. Here, we present a mathematical model that shows signaling specificity can arise through asymmetric hierarchical inhibition. The parameters of our model are, where possible, based on experimental data that allow us to determine the constraints imposed by signaling specificity on these parameters. Our model is in broad agreement with experimental observations to date and generates testable predictions that may stimulate further research.},

title = {Mapping 70S ribosomes in intact cells by cryoelectron tomography and pattern recognition},
abstract = {Cryoelectron tomography (CET) combines the potential of three-dimensional (3D) imaging with a close-to-life preservation of biological samples. It allows the examination of large and stochastically variable structures, such as organelles or whole cells. At the current resolution it becomes possible to visualize large macromolecular complexes in their functional cellular environments. Pattern recognition methods can be used for a systematic interpretation of the tomograms; target molecules are identified and located based on their structural signature and their correspondence with a template. Here, we demonstrate that such an approach can be used to map 70S ribosomes in an intact prokaryotic cell (Spiroplasma melliferum) with high fidelity, in spite of the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the tomograms. At a resolution of 4.7 nm the average generated from the 236 ribosomes found in a tomogram is in good agreement with high resolution structures of isolated ribosomes as obtained by X-ray crystallography or cryoelectron microscopy. Under the conditions of the experiment (logarithmic growth phase) the ribosomes are evenly distributed throughout the cytosol, occupying approximately 5% of the cellular volume. A subset of about 15% is found in close proximity to and with a distinct orientation with respect to the plasma membrane. This study represents a first step towards generating a more comprehensive cellular atlas of macromolecular complexes.},

abstract = {In vivo induction of the Escherichia coli lactose operon as a function of inducer concentration generates a sigmoidal curve, indicating a non-linear response. Suggested explanations for this dependence include a 2:1 inducer-repressor stoichiometry of induction, which is the currently accepted view. It is, however, known for decades that, in vitro, operator binding as a function of inducer concentration is not sigmoidal. This discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data has so far not been resolved. We demonstrate that the in vivo non-linearity of induction is due to cooperative repression of the wild-type lac operon through DNA loop formation. In the absence of DNA loops, in vivo induction curves are hyperbolic. In the light of this result, we re-address the question of functional molecular inducer-repressor stoichiometry in induction of the lac operon.},

abstract = {The Inhomogeneous Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (ISSA) is a variant of the stochastic simulation algorithm in which the spatially inhomogeneous volume of the system is divided into homogeneous subvolumes, and the chemical reactions in those subvolumes are augmented by diffusive transfers of molecules between adjacent subvolumes. The ISSA can be prohibitively slow when the system is such that diffusive transfers occur much more frequently than chemical reactions. In this paper we present the Multinomial Simulation Algorithm (MSA), which is designed to, on the one hand, outperform the ISSA when diffusive transfer events outnumber reaction events, and on the other, to handle small reactant populations with greater accuracy than deterministic-stochastic hybrid algorithms. The MSA treats reactions in the usual ISSA fashion, but uses appropriately conditioned binomial random variables for representing the net numbers of molecules diffusing from any given subvolume to a neighbor within a prescribed distance. Simulation results illustrate the benefits of the algorithm.},

At intermediate inducer concentrations, a population of genetically identical cells exhibits two phenotypes: induced cells with highly fluorescent membranes and uninduced cells with a small number of membrane-bound permeases. We found that this basal-level expression results from partial dissociation of the tetrameric lactose repressor from one of its operators on looped DNA. In contrast, infrequent events of complete dissociation of the repressor from DNA result in large bursts of permease expression that trigger induction of the lac operon. Hence, a stochastic single-molecule event determines a cell's phenotype.},

title = {RNAG: A New Gibbs Sampler for Predicting RNA Secondary Structure for Unaligned Sequences},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA secondary structure plays an important role in the function of many RNAs, and structural features are often key to their interaction with other cellular components. Thus, there has been considerable interest in the prediction of secondary structures for RNA families. In this paper, we present a new global structural alignment algorithm, RNAG, to predict consensus secondary structures for unaligned sequences. It uses a blocked Gibbs sampling algorithm, which has a theoretical advantage in convergence time. This algorithm iteratively samples from the conditional probability distributions P(Structure | Alignment) and P(Alignment | Structure). Not surprisingly, there is considerable uncertainly in the high dimensional space of this difficult problem, which has so far received limited attention in this field. We show how the samples drawn from this algorithm can be used to more fully characterize the posterior space and to assess the uncertainty of predictions. RESULTS: Our analysis of three publically available datasets showed a substantial improvement in RNA structure prediction by RNAG over extant prediction methods. Additionally, our analysis of 17 RNA families showed that the RNAG sampled structures were generally compact around their ensemble centroids, and at least eleven families had at least two well-separated clusters of predicted structures. In general, the distance between a reference structure and our predicted structure was large relative to the variation among structures within an ensemble. AVAILABILITY: The Python implementation of the RNAG algorithm and the data necessary to reproduce the results described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are available at http://ccmbweb.ccv.brown.edu/rnag.html CONTACT: Charles_Lawrence@brown.edu.},

Recently, there has been great effort to measure single cells using microelectromechanical systems technology, and several important questions have been explored. However, a unified, easy-to-use methodology to measure the growth rate of individual adherent cells of various sizes has been lacking. Here we demonstrate that a newly developed optical interferometric technique, known as spatial light interference microscopy, can measure the cell dry mass of many individual adherent cells in various conditions, over spatial scales from micrometers to millimeters, temporal scales ranging from seconds to days, and cell types ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells. We found evidence of exponential growth in Escherichia coli, which agrees very well with other recent reports. Perhaps most importantly, combining spatial light interference microscopy with fluorescence imaging provides a unique method for studying cell cycle-dependent growth. Thus, by using a fluorescent reporter for the S phase, we measured single cell growth over each phase of the cell cycle in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells and found that the G2 phase exhibits the highest growth rate, which is mass-dependent and can be approximated by an exponential.},

title = {Crowding and hydrodynamic interactions likely dominate in vivo macromolecular motion},
abstract = {To begin to elucidate the principles of intermolecular dynamics in the crowded environment of cells, employing brownian dynamics (BD) simulations, we examined possible mechanism(s) responsible for the great reduction in diffusion constants of macromolecules in vivo from that at infinite dilution. In an Escherichia coli cytoplasm model comprised of 15 different macromolecule types at physiological concentrations, BD simulations of molecular-shaped and equivalent sphere representations were performed with a soft repulsive potential. At cellular concentrations, the calculated diffusion constant of GFP is much larger than experiment, with no significant shape dependence. Next, using the equivalent sphere system, hydrodynamic interactions (HI) were considered. Without adjustable parameters, the in vivo experimental GFP diffusion constant was reproduced. Finally, the effects of nonspecific attractive interactions were examined. The reduction in diffusivity is very sensitive to macromolecular radius with the motion of the largest macromolecules dramatically slowed down; this is not seen if HI dominate. In addition, long-lived clusters involving the largest macromolecules form if attractions dominate, whereas HI give rise to significant, size independent intermolecular dynamic correlations. These qualitative differences provide a testable means of differentiating the importance of HI vs. nonspecific attractive interactions on macromolecular motion in cells.},

title = {Transcription and decay of the lac messenger: role of an intergenic terminator},
abstract = {Prior work has indicated that the polycistronic lacZYA mRNA of Escherichia coli is cleaved during decay at approximately intergenic sites (L. W. Lim and D. Kennell, J. Mol. Biol. 135: 369-390, 1979). In this work, we characterized the products by using probes specific for the different cistrons. This analysis indicated that six lac mRNA species are present in the following order of decreasing abundance: lacZ, -A, -ZYA, -ZY, -YA, and -Y. Very little lacYA and lacY mRNAs were present, whereas in cells induced to steady state, there was 10 times more lacZ than lacZYA mRNA. The lacZ mRNA appeared as a discrete species extending to a site in the lacZ-Y intergenic space (ca. residue 3150). This site is just distal to a potential rho-independent termination sequence. We examined the function of this sequence to determine whether it contributes to the distribution of the mRNAs. Although the termination sequence was shown to function in vitro, when it was recloned into an expression vector, no termination was seen in vivo. Moreover, direct examination of the kinetics of lac messenger synthesis revealed that after initiation, most transcription continued to the end of the operon. We conclude that during normal growth, the operon is transcribed in its entirety and that the individual lac mRNAs are formed by cleavage. These results confirm earlier work implying that the lac operon is transcribed in its entirety but are in conflict with several recent reports suggesting that internal termination occurs. Our findings indicate that the natural polarity of the operon (lacZ is expressed sixfold more strongly than lacA) is based on posttranslational effects and not on polarity of transcription.},

title = {Extinction of metastable stochastic populations},
abstract = {We investigate the phenomenon of extinction of a long-lived self-regulating stochastic population, caused by intrinsic (demographic) noise. Extinction typically occurs via one of two scenarios depending on whether the absorbing state n=0 is a repelling (scenario A) or attracting (scenario B) point of the deterministic rate equation. In scenario A the metastable stochastic population resides in the vicinity of an attracting fixed point next to the repelling point n=0 . In scenario B there is an intermediate repelling point n=n1 between the attracting point n=0 and another attracting point n=n2 in the vicinity of which the metastable population resides. The crux of the theory is a dissipative variant of WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation which assumes that the typical population size in the metastable state is large. Starting from the master equation, we calculate the quasistationary probability distribution of the population sizes and the (exponentially long) mean time to extinction for each of the two scenarios. When necessary, the WKB approximation is complemented (i) by a recursive solution of the quasistationary master equation at small n and (ii) by the van Kampen system-size expansion, valid near the fixed points of the deterministic rate equation. The theory yields both entropic barriers to extinction and pre-exponential factors, and holds for a general set of multistep processes when detailed balance is broken. The results simplify considerably for single-step processes and near the characteristic bifurcations of scenarios A and B.},

abstract = {Until recently, a dedicated mitotic apparatus that segregates newly replicated chromosomes into daughter cells was believed to be unique to eukaryotic cells. Here we demonstrate that the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus segregates its chromosome using a partitioning (Par) apparatus that has surprising similarities to eukaryotic spindles. We show that the C. crescentus ATPase ParA forms linear polymers in vitro and assembles into a narrow linear structure in vivo. The centromere-binding protein ParB binds to and destabilizes ParA structures in vitro. We propose that this ParB-stimulated ParA depolymerization activity moves the centromere to the opposite cell pole through a burnt bridge Brownian ratchet mechanism. Finally, we identify the pole-specific TipN protein as a new component of the Par system that is required to maintain the directionality of DNA transfer towards the new cell pole. Our results elucidate a bacterial chromosome segregation mechanism that features basic operating principles similar to eukaryotic mitotic machines, including a multivalent protein complex at the centromere that stimulates the dynamic disassembly of polymers to move chromosomes into daughter compartments.},

title = {Protein abundance profiling of the Escherichia coli cytosol},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the abundance of molecular components is an important prerequisite for building quantitative predictive models of cellular behavior. Proteins are central components of these models, since they carry out most of the fundamental processes in the cell. Thus far, protein concentrations have been difficult to measure on a large scale, but proteomic technologies have now advanced to a stage where this information becomes readily accessible.

RESULTS: Here, we describe an experimental scheme to maximize the coverage of proteins identified by mass spectrometry of a complex biological sample. Using a combination of LC-MS/MS approaches with protein and peptide fractionation steps we identified 1103 proteins from the cytosolic fraction of the Escherichia coli strain MC4100. A measure of abundance is presented for each of the identified proteins, based on the recently developed emPAI approach which takes into account the number of sequenced peptides per protein. The values of abundance are within a broad range and accurately reflect independently measured copy numbers per cell. As expected, the most abundant proteins were those involved in protein synthesis, most notably ribosomal proteins. Proteins involved in energy metabolism as well as those with binding function were also found in high copy number while proteins annotated with the terms metabolism, transcription, transport, and cellular organization were rare. The barrel-sandwich fold was found to be the structural fold with the highest abundance. Highly abundant proteins are predicted to be less prone to aggregation based on their length, pI values, and occurrence patterns of hydrophobic stretches. We also find that abundant proteins tend to be predominantly essential. Additionally we observe a significant correlation between protein and mRNA abundance in E. coli cells.

CONCLUSION: Abundance measurements for more than 1000 E. coli proteins presented in this work represent the most complete study of protein abundance in a bacterial cell so far. We show significant associations between the abundance of a protein and its properties and functions in the cell. In this way, we provide both data and novel insights into the role of protein concentration in this model organism.},

title = {HIV Promoter Integration Site Primarily Modulates Transcriptional Burst Size Rather Than Frequency},
abstract = {Mammalian gene expression patterns, and their variability across populations of cells, are regulated by factors specific to each gene in concert with its surrounding cellular and genomic environment. Lentiviruses such as HIV integrate their genomes into semi-random genomic locations in the cells they infect, and the resulting viral gene expression provides a natural system to dissect the contributions of genomic environment to transcriptional regulation. Previously, we showed that expression heterogeneity and its modulation by specific host factors at HIV integration sites are key determinants of infected-cell fate and a possible source of latent infections. Here, we assess the integration context dependence of expression heterogeneity from diverse single integrations of a HIV-promoter/GFP-reporter cassette in Jurkat T-cells. Systematically fitting a stochastic model of gene expression to our data reveals an underlying transcriptional dynamic, by which multiple transcripts are produced during short, infrequent bursts, that quantitatively accounts for the wide, highly skewed protein expression distributions observed in each of our clonal cell populations. Interestingly, we find that the size of transcriptional bursts is the primary systematic covariate over integration sites, varying from a few to tens of transcripts across integration sites, and correlating well with mean expression. In contrast, burst frequencies are scattered about a typical value of several per cell-division time and demonstrate little correlation with the clonal means. This pattern of modulation generates consistently noisy distributions over the sampled integration positions, with large expression variability relative to the mean maintained even for the most productive integrations, and could contribute to specifying heterogeneous, integration-site-dependent viral production patterns in HIV-infected cells. Genomic environment thus emerges as a significant control parameter for gene expression variation that may contribute to structuring mammalian genomes, as well as be exploited for survival by integrating viruses.},

abstract = {Molecular diffusion and transport are fundamental processes in physical, chemical, biochemical, and biological systems. However, current approaches to measure molecular transport in cells and tissues based on perturbation methods such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching are invasive, fluctuation correlation methods are local, and single-particle tracking requires the observation of isolated particles for relatively long periods of time. We propose to detect molecular transport by measuring the time cross-correlation of fluctuations at a pair of locations in the sample. When the points are farther apart than two times the size of the point spread function, the maximum of the correlation is proportional to the average time a molecule takes to move from a specific location to another. We demonstrate the method by simulations, using beads in solution, and by measuring the diffusion of molecules in cellular membranes. The spatial pair cross-correlation method detects barriers to diffusion and heterogeneity of diffusion because the time of the correlation maximum is delayed in the presence of diffusion barriers. This noninvasive, sensitive technique follows the same molecule over a large area, thereby producing a map of molecular flow. It does not require isolated molecules, and thus many molecules can be labeled at the same time and within the point spread function.},

Three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge. We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension.

title = {Min protein patterns emerge from rapid rebinding and membrane interaction of MinE},
abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the pole-to-pole oscillation of the Min proteins directs septum formation to midcell, which is required for symmetric cell division. In vitro, protein waves emerge from the self-organization of MinD, a membrane-binding ATPase, and its activator MinE. For wave propagation, the proteins need to cycle through states of collective membrane binding and unbinding. Although MinD presumably undergoes cooperative membrane attachment, it is unclear how synchronous detachment is coordinated. We used confocal and single-molecule microscopy to elucidate the order of events during Min wave propagation. We propose that protein detachment at the rear of the wave, and the formation of the E-ring, are accomplished by two complementary processes: first, local accumulation of MinE due to rapid rebinding, leading to dynamic instability; and second, a structural change induced by membrane-interaction of MinE in an equimolar MinD-MinE (MinDE) complex, which supports the robustness of pattern formation.},

title = {Single-cell NF-kappaB dynamics reveal digital activation and analogue information processing},
abstract = {Cells operate in dynamic environments using extraordinary communication capabilities that emerge from the interactions of genetic circuitry. The mammalian immune response is a striking example of the coordination of different cell types. Cell-to-cell communication is primarily mediated by signalling molecules that form spatiotemporal concentration gradients, requiring cells to respond to a wide range of signal intensities. Here we use high-throughput microfluidic cell culture and fluorescence microscopy, quantitative gene expression analysis and mathematical modelling to investigate how single mammalian cells respond to different concentrations of the signalling molecule tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and relay information to the gene expression programs by means of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. We measured NF-kappaB activity in thousands of live cells under TNF-alpha doses covering four orders of magnitude. We find, in contrast to population-level studies with bulk assays, that the activation is heterogeneous and is a digital process at the single-cell level with fewer cells responding at lower doses. Cells also encode a subtle set of analogue parameters to modulate the outcome; these parameters include NF-kappaB peak intensity, response time and number of oscillations. We developed a stochastic mathematical model that reproduces both the digital and analogue dynamics as well as most gene expression profiles at all measured conditions, constituting a broadly applicable model for TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB signalling in various types of cells. These results highlight the value of high-throughput quantitative measurements with single-cell resolution in understanding how biological systems operate.},

title = {Stochastic mRNA synthesis in mammalian cells},
abstract = {Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise.},

title = {Individual histories and selection in heterogeneous populations},
abstract = {The strength of selection in populations has traditionally been inferred by measuring changes in bulk population parameters, such as mean reproductive rates. Untangling the effect of selection from other factors, such as specific responses to environmental fluctuations, poses a significant problem both in microbiology and in other fields, including cancer biology and immunology, where selection occurs within phenotypically heterogeneous populations of cells. Using "individual histories"--temporal sequences of all reproduction events and phenotypic changes of individuals and their ancestors--we present an alternative approach to quantifying selection in diverse experimental settings. Selection is viewed as a process that acts on histories, and a measure of selection that employs the distribution of histories is introduced. We apply this measure to phenotypically structured populations in fluctuating environments across different evolutionary regimes. Additionally, we show that reproduction events alone, recorded in the population's tree of cell divisions, may be sufficient to accurately measure selection. The measure is thus applicable in a wide range of biological systems, from microorganisms--including species for which genetic tools do not yet exist--to cellular populations, such as tumors and stem cells, where detailed temporal data are becoming available.},

title = {Gene regulation at the single-cell level},
abstract = {The quantitative relation between transcription factor concentrations and the rate of protein production from downstream genes is central to the function of genetic networks. Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter P(R) in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.},

title = {Noise-induced Min phenotypes in E. coli},
abstract = {The spatiotemporal oscillations of the Escherichia coli proteins MinD and MinE direct cell division to the region between the chromosomes. Several quantitative models of the Min system have been suggested before, but no one of them accounts for the behavior of all documented mutant phenotypes. We analyzed the stochastic reaction-diffusion kinetics of the Min proteins for several E. coli mutants and compared the results to the corresponding deterministic mean-field description. We found that wild-type (wt) and filamentous (ftsZ-) cells are well characterized by the mean-field model, but that a stochastic model is necessary to account for several of the characteristics of the spherical (rodA-) and phospathedylethanolamide-deficient (PE-) phenotypes. For spherical cells, the mean-field model is bistable, and the system can get trapped in a non-oscillatory state. However, when the intrinsic noise is considered, only the experimentally observed oscillatory behavior remains. The stochastic model also reproduces the change in oscillation directions observed in the spherical phenotype and the occasional gliding of the MinD region along the inner membrane. For the PE- mutant, the stochastic model explains the appearance of randomly localized and dense MinD clusters as a nucleation phenomenon, in which the stochastic kinetics at low copy number causes local discharges of the high MinD(ATP) to MinD(ADP) potential. We find that a simple five-reaction model of the Min system can explain all documented Min phenotypes, if stochastic kinetics and three-dimensional diffusion are accounted for. Our results emphasize that local copy number fluctuation may result in phenotypic differences although the total number of molecules of the relevant species is high.},

Two types of distance are discussed: the Kolmogorov distance and the histogram distance. The self-distance, an important property of Monte-Carlo methods that quantifies the accuracy limitation at a given resolution for a given number of realizations, is defined and studied. Estimation for- mulas are established for the histogram and the Kolmogorov self-distance. These formulas do not depend on the dis- tribution of the samples, and thus show a property of the Monte-Carlo method itself. Numerical results demonstrate that the formulas are very accurate. Application of these results to two problems of current interest in the simulation of biochemical systems is discussed.},

title = {Dual binding mode of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex reveals a novel universal adapter site on the ribosome},
abstract = {Nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) was identified in eukaryotes as the first cytosolic factor that contacts the nascent polypeptide chain emerging from the ribosome. NAC is present as a homodimer in archaea and as a highly conserved heterodimer in eukaryotes. Mutations in NAC cause severe embryonically lethal phenotypes in mice, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAC is quantitatively associated with ribosomes. Here we show that NAC contacts several ribosomal proteins. The N terminus of betaNAC, however, specifically contacts near the tunnel exit ribosomal protein Rpl31, which is unique to eukaryotes and archaea. Moreover, the first 23 amino acids of betaNAC are sufficient to direct an otherwise non-associated protein to the ribosome. In contrast, alphaNAC (Egd2p) contacts Rpl17, the direct neighbor of Rpl31 at the ribosomal tunnel exit site. Rpl31 was also recently identified as a contact site for the SRP receptor and the ribosome-associated complex. Furthermore, in Escherichia coli peptide deformylase (PDF) interacts with the corresponding surface area on the eubacterial ribosome. In addition to the previously identified universal adapter site represented by Rpl25/Rpl35, we therefore refer to Rpl31/Rpl17 as a novel universal docking site for ribosome-associated factors on the eukaryotic ribosome.},

title = {Genome-scale reconstruction of Escherichia coli's transcriptional and translational machinery: a knowledge base, its mathematical formulation, and its functional characterization},
abstract = {Metabolic network reconstructions represent valuable scaffolds for '-omics' data integration and are used to computationally interrogate network properties. However, they do not explicitly account for the synthesis of macromolecules (i.e., proteins and RNA). Here, we present the first genome-scale, fine-grained reconstruction of Escherichia coli's transcriptional and translational machinery, which produces 423 functional gene products in a sequence-specific manner and accounts for all necessary chemical transformations. Legacy data from over 500 publications and three databases were reviewed, and many pathways were considered, including stable RNA maturation and modification, protein complex formation, and iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. This reconstruction represents the most comprehensive knowledge base for these important cellular functions in E. coli and is unique in its scope. Furthermore, it was converted into a mathematical model and used to: (1) quantitatively integrate gene expression data as reaction constraints and (2) compute functional network states, which were compared to reported experimental data. For example, the model predicted accurately the ribosome production, without any parameterization. Also, in silico rRNA operon deletion suggested that a high RNA polymerase density on the remaining rRNA operons is needed to reproduce the reported experimental ribosome numbers. Moreover, functional protein modules were determined, and many were found to contain gene products from multiple subsystems, highlighting the functional interaction of these proteins. This genome-scale reconstruction of E. coli's transcriptional and translational machinery presents a milestone in systems biology because it will enable quantitative integration of '-omics' datasets and thus the study of the mechanistic principles underlying the genotype-phenotype relationship.},

These stochastic events of protein production are difficult to observe directly with measurements on large ensembles of cells owing to lack of synchronization among cells. Measurements so far on single cells lack the sensitivity to resolve individual events of protein production. Here we demonstrate a microfluidic-based assay that allows real-time observation of the expression of beta-galactosidase in living Escherichia coli cells with single molecule sensitivity. We observe that protein production occurs in bursts, with the number of molecules per burst following an exponential distribution. We show that the two key parameters of protein expression--the burst size and frequency--can be either determined directly from real-time monitoring of protein production or extracted from a measurement of the steady-state copy number distribution in a population of cells. Application of this assay to probe gene expression in individual budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrates its generality. Many important proteins are expressed at low levels, and are thus inaccessible by current genomic and proteomic techniques. This microfluidic single cell assay opens up possibilities for system-wide characterization of the expression of these low copy number proteins.},

title = {Morphological analysis of the division cycle of two Escherichia coli substrains during slow growth},
abstract = {Morphological parameters of the cell division cycle have been examined in Escherichia coli B/r A and K. Whereas the shape factor (length of newborn cell/width) of the two strains was the same at rapid growth (doubling time, tau, less than 60 min), with decreasing growth rate the dimensions of the two strains did change so that B/r A cells became more rounded and B/r K cells became more elongated. The process of visible cell constriction (T period) lasted longer in B/r A than in B/r K during slow growth, reaching at tau = 200 min values of 40 and 17 min, respectively. The time between termination of chromosome replication and cell division (D period) was found to be longer in B/r A than in B/r K. As a result, in either strain completion of chromosome replication seemed always to occur before initiation of cell constriction. Nucleoplasmic separation did not coincide with termination as during rapid growth but occurred in both strains within the T period, about 10 min before cell division.},

title = {Metabolic gene regulation in a dynamically changing environment},
abstract = {Natural selection dictates that cells constantly adapt to dynamically changing environments in a context-dependent manner. Gene-regulatory networks often mediate the cellular response to perturbation, and an understanding of cellular adaptation will require experimental approaches aimed at subjecting cells to a dynamic environment that mimics their natural habitat. Here we monitor the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic gene regulation to periodic changes in the external carbon source by using a microfluidic platform that allows precise, dynamic control over environmental conditions. We show that the metabolic system acts as a low-pass filter that reliably responds to a slowly changing environment, while effectively ignoring fast fluctuations. The sensitive low-frequency response was significantly faster than in predictions arising from our computational modelling, and this discrepancy was resolved by the discovery that two key galactose transcripts possess half-lives that depend on the carbon source. Finally, to explore how induction characteristics affect frequency response, we compare two S. cerevisiae strains and show that they have the same frequency response despite having markedly different induction properties. This suggests that although certain characteristics of the complex networks may differ when probed in a static environment, the system has been optimized for a robust response to a dynamically changing environment.},

title = {Photoconversion using confocal laser scanning microscopy: A new tool for the ultrastructural analysis of fluorescently labeled cellular elements},
abstract = {Photoconversion, the method by which a fluorescent dye is transformed into a stable, osmiophilic product that can be visualized by transmission electron microscopy, is the most widely used method to enable the ultrastructural analysis of fluorescently labeled cellular structures. Nevertheless, the conventional method of photoconversion using widefield fluorescence microscopy requires long reaction times and results in low resolution cell targeting which limit its utility. Accordingly, we developed a photoconversion method that ameliorates these limitations by adapting confocal laser scanning microscopy to the procedure. We confirmed that photoconversion times were dramatically reduced when using a confocal laser scanning microscope in the photoconversion process. We also demonstrated that the region of interest scanning capabilities of a confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an acousto-optical tunable filter represented a unique tool to facilitate the targeting of the photoconversion process to individual cellular or subcellular elements within a fluorescent field. Moreover, region of interest scanning greatly reduced the area of the cell exposed to light energy, ameliorating the ultrastructural damage common to this process when widefield microscopes are employed. The potential of this new methodology extends beyond the neurosciences to any scientific modality which requires ultrastructural analysis of fluorescently labeled specimens, especially those where discrete photoconversion on a cellular or subcellular basis could be beneficial.},

Extracts from yeast strains expressing only C-terminally tagged Rpl25 protein or overexpressing this protein in the presence of endogenous Rpl25p were used as the starling materials. The purification was specific for tagged 60S subunits, and resulted in the copurification of 80S subunits and polysomes, as well as ribosome-associated proteins and mRNAs. Two of these associated proteins, Mpt4p and Asc1p, were nearly stoichiometrically bound to the ribosome. In addition, the degree of mRNA association with the purified ribosomes was found to reflect the mRNA's translational status within the cell. The one-step purification of ribosome and its associated components from a crude extract should provide an important tool for future structural and biochemical studies of the ribosome, as well as for expression profiling of translated mRNAs.},

title = {Coarse-grained models for simulations of multiprotein complexes: application to ubiquitin binding},
abstract = {We develop coarse-grained models and effective energy functions for simulating thermodynamic and structural properties of multiprotein complexes with relatively low binding affinity (K(d) >1 microM) and apply them to binding of Vps27 to membrane-tethered ubiquitin. Folded protein domains are represented as rigid bodies. The interactions between the domains are treated at the residue level with amino-acid-dependent pair potentials and Debye-H{\"u}ckel-type electrostatic interactions. Flexible linker peptides connecting rigid protein domains are represented as amino acid beads on a polymer with appropriate stretching, bending, and torsion-angle potentials. In simulations of membrane-attached protein complexes, interactions between amino acids and the membrane are described by residue-dependent short-range potentials and long-range electrostatics. We parameterize the energy functions by fitting the osmotic second virial coefficient of lysozyme and the binding affinity of the ubiquitin-CUE complex. For validation, extensive replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations are performed of various protein complexes. Binding affinities for these complexes are in good agreement with the experimental data. The simulated structures are clustered on the basis of distance matrices between two proteins and ranked according to cluster population. In approximately 70% of the complexes, the distance root-mean-square is less than 5 A from the experimental structures. In approximately 90% of the complexes, the binding interfaces on both proteins are predicted correctly, and in all other cases at least one interface is correct. Transient and nonspecifically bound structures are also observed. With the validated model, we simulate the interaction between the Vps27 multiprotein complex and a membrane-tethered ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is found to bind preferentially to the two UIM domains of Vps27, but transient interactions between ubiquitin and the VHS and FYVE domains are observed as well. These specific and nonspecific interactions are found to be positively cooperative, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the overall binding affinity beyond the approximately 300 microM of the specific domains. We also find that the interactions between ubiquitin and Vps27 are highly dynamic, with conformational rearrangements enabling binding of Vps27 to diverse targets as part of the multivesicular-body protein-sorting pathway.},

abstract = {We have comprehensively mapped long-range associations between chromosomal regions throughout the fission yeast genome using the latest genomics approach that combines next generation sequencing and chromosome conformation capture (3C). Our relatively simple approach, referred to as enrichment of ligation products (ELP), involves digestion of the 3C sample with a 4 bp cutter and self-ligation, achieving a resolution of 20 kb. It recaptures previously characterized genome organizations and also identifies new and important interactions. We have modeled the 3D structure of the entire fission yeast genome and have explored the functional relationships between the global genome organization and transcriptional regulation. We find significant associations among highly transcribed genes. Moreover, we demonstrate that genes co-regulated during the cell cycle tend to associate with one another when activated. Remarkably, functionally defined genes derived from particular gene ontology groups tend to associate in a statistically significant manner. Those significantly associating genes frequently contain the same DNA motifs at their promoter regions, suggesting that potential transcription factors binding to these motifs are involved in defining the associations among those genes. Our study suggests the presence of a global genome organization in fission yeast that is functionally similar to the recently proposed mammalian transcription factory.},

The recently solved X-ray crystal structures of archaeal RNAP allow a structural comparison of the transcription machinery among all three domains of life. The archaea were once thought of closely related to bacteria, but they are now considered to be more closely related to the eukaryote at the molecular level than bacteria. According to these structures, the archaeal transcription apparatus, which includes RNAP and general transcription factors (GTFs), is similar to the eukaryotic transcription machinery. Yet, the transcription regulators, activators and repressors, encoded by archaeal genomes are closely related to bacterial factors. Therefore, archaeal transcription appears to possess an intriguing hybrid of eukaryotic-type transcription apparatus and bacterial-like regulatory mechanisms. Elucidating the transcription mechanism in archaea, which possesses a combination of bacterial and eukaryotic transcription mechanisms that are commonly regarded as separate and mutually exclusive, can provide data that will bring basic transcription mechanisms across all life forms.},

abstract = {We show far-field fluorescence nanoscopy of different structural elements labeled with an organic dye within living mammalian cells. The diffraction barrier limiting far-field light microscopy is outperformed by using stimulated emission depletion. We used the tagging protein hAGT (SNAP-tag), which covalently binds benzylguanine-substituted organic dyes, for labeling. Tetramethylrhodamine was used to image the cytoskeleton (vimentin and microtubule-associated protein 2) as well as structures located at the cell membrane (caveolin and connexin-43) with a resolution down to 40 nm. Comparison with structures labeled with the yellow fluorescent protein Citrine validates this labeling approach. Nanoscopic movies showing the movement of connexin-43 clusters across the cell membrane evidence the capability of this technique to observe structural changes on the nanoscale over time. Pulsed or continuous-wave lasers for excitation and stimulated emission depletion yield images of similar resolution in living cells. Hence fusion proteins that bind modified organic dyes expand widely the application range of far-field fluorescence nanoscopy of living cells.},

title = {Methanol-dependent gene expression demonstrates that methyl-coenzyme M reductase is essential in Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A and allows isolation of mutants with defects in regulation of the methanol utilization pathway},
abstract = {Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A is able to convert several substrates to methane via at least four distinct methanogenic pathways. A common step in each of these pathways is the reduction of methyl-coenzyme M (CoM) to methane catalyzed by methyl-CoM reductase (MCR). Because this enzyme is used in each of the known pathways, the mcrBDCGA operon, which encodes MCR, is expected to be essential. To validate this prediction, a system for conditional gene inactivation was developed. A heterologous copy of the mcrBDCGA operon was placed under the control of the highly regulated mtaC1 promoter, which directs the expression of genes involved in methanol utilization, and recombined onto the M. acetivorans chromosome. This allowed for disruption of the endogenous mcr operon in the presence of methanol. Because the PmtaC1 promoter is transcribed only during growth on methanol, mcrBDCGA was rendered methanol dependent and the strain was unable to grow in trimethylamine media, strongly suggesting that mcrBDCGA is essential. Upon prolonged incubation, suppressed mutants which expressed mcrBDCGA constitutively could be selected. Expression analysis of PmtaC1::uidA gene fusions in several isolated suppressed mutants suggests that they carry trans-active mutations leading to deregulation of all genes under control of this promoter. Subsequently, proteome analysis of one such suppressed mutant revealed that all known proteins derived from mtaC1 promoter-dependent expression were constitutively expressed in this mutant. This genetic system can therefore be employed for the testing of essential genes and for the identification of genes under a common regulatory mechanism by making regulatory mutations phenotypically selectable.},

title = {Structure of an archaeal non-discriminating glutamyl-tRNA synthetase: a missing link in the evolution of Gln-tRNAGln formation},
abstract = {The molecular basis of the genetic code relies on the specific ligation of amino acids to their cognate tRNA molecules. However, two pathways exist for the formation of Gln-tRNA(Gln). The evolutionarily older indirect route utilizes a non-discriminating glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (ND-GluRS) that can form both Glu-tRNA(Glu) and Glu-tRNA(Gln). The Glu-tRNA(Gln) is then converted to Gln-tRNA(Gln) by an amidotransferase. Since the well-characterized bacterial ND-GluRS enzymes recognize tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln) with an unrelated alpha-helical cage domain in contrast to the beta-barrel anticodon-binding domain in archaeal and eukaryotic GluRSs, the mode of tRNA(Glu)/tRNA(Gln) discrimination in archaea and eukaryotes was unknown. Here, we present the crystal structure of the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus ND-GluRS, which is the evolutionary predecessor of both the glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) and the eukaryotic discriminating GluRS. Comparison with the previously solved structure of the Escherichia coli GlnRS-tRNA(Gln) complex reveals the structural determinants responsible for specific tRNA(Gln) recognition by GlnRS compared to promiscuous recognition of both tRNAs by the ND-GluRS. The structure also shows the amino acid recognition pocket of GluRS is more variable than that found in GlnRS. Phylogenetic analysis is used to reconstruct the key events in the evolution from indirect to direct genetic encoding of glutamine.},

title = {Exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) for estimation of absolute protein amount in proteomics by the number of sequenced peptides per protein},
abstract = {To estimate absolute protein contents in complex mixtures, we previously defined a protein abundance index (PAI) as the number of observed peptides divided by the number of observable peptides per protein (Rappsilber, J., Ryder, U., Lamond, A. I., and Mann, M. (2002) Large-scale proteomic analysis of the human spliceosome. Genome. Res. 12, 1231-1245). Here we report that PAI values obtained at different concentrations of serum albumin show a linear relationship with the logarithm of protein concentration in LC-MS/MS experiments. This was also the case for 46 proteins in a mouse whole cell lysate. For absolute quantitation, PAI was converted to exponentially modified PAI (emPAI), equal to 10PAI minus one, which is proportional to protein content in a protein mixture. For the 46 proteins in the whole lysate, the deviation percentages of the emPAI-based abundances from the actual values were within 63% on average, similar or better than determination of abundance by protein staining. emPAI was applied to comprehensive protein expression analysis and to a comparison study between gene and protein expression in a human cancer cell line, HCT116. The values of emPAI are easily calculated and add important quantitation information to proteomic experiments; therefore we suggest that they should be reported in large scale proteomic identification projects.},
